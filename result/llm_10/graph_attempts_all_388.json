            "Amazing Stories\nAmazing Stories is an American science fiction magazine launched in April 1926 by Hugo Gernsback's Experimenter Publishing. It was the first magazine devoted solely to science fiction. Science fiction stories had made regular appearances in other magazines, including some published by Gernsback, but \"Amazing\" helped define and launch a new genre of pulp fiction.",
            "Amazing Stories Quarterly\nAmazing Stories Quarterly was a U.S. science fiction pulp magazine published from 1928 to 1934. It was launched by Hugo Gernsback as a companion to his \"Amazing Stories\", the first science fiction magazine, which had begun publishing in April 1926. \"Amazing Stories\" had been successful enough for Gernsback to try a single issue of \"Amazing Stories Annual\" in 1927, which had sold well, and he decided to follow it up with a quarterly magazine. The first issue of \"Amazing Stories Quarterly\" was dated Winter 1928 and carried a reprint of H.G. Wells' \"When the Sleeper Wakes\". Gernsback's policy of running a novel in each issue was popular with his readership, though the choice of Wells' novel was less so. Over the next five issues only one more reprint appeared: Gernsback's own novel \"Ralph 124C 41+\", in the Winter 1929 issue. Gernsback went bankrupt in early 1929, and lost control of both \"Amazing Stories\" and \"Amazing Stories Quarterly\"; his assistant, T. O'Conor Sloane, took over as editor. The magazine began to run into financial difficulties in 1932, and the schedule became irregular; the last issue was dated Fall 1934.",

Another collection of short stories about robots, \"I, Robot\", was re-published in the previous year, which is why Asimov chose to title the collection as \"The Rest of the Robots\". None of the short stories in this collection were in \"I, Robot\", however all of them were later included in \"The Complete Robot\", and both novels about Elijah Baley were also published separately.",

In the 1940s, \"Story\" was an important magazine in that it published the first or early works of many writers who went on to become major authors. Not only did Burnett prove to be a valuable literary birddog for new talent, but \"Story\" remained a respectable though low-paying (typically $25 per story) alternative for stories rejected by the large-circulation slick magazines published on glossy paper like \"Collier's\" or \"The Saturday Evening Post\" or the somewhat more prestigious and literary slick magazines such as \"The New Yorker\".

The game is a variation of Deuces Wild and is based on five card draw where the player is dealt a five card hand. The player can then choose which cards to keep or discard and is dealt new cards accordingly. The payoff is based on the value of the hand. The \"wild card\" is announced before the hand is dealt and can be substituted for any card in the deck according to what is most beneficial to the player's hand. Since the game uses a standard deck, there are always four \"wild cards\" in play. This allows the player greater flexibility in building a winning hand.",
            "I Love to Laugh\n\"I Love to Laugh\", also called \"We Love to Laugh\", is a song from Walt Disney's film \"Mary Poppins\". It was composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. The song is sung in the film by \"Uncle Albert\" (Ed Wynn), and \"Bert\" (Dick Van Dyke) as they levitate uncontrollably toward the ceiling, eventually joined by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) herself. The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can \"lighten\" a mood. (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.) Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors \"down to earth\" again. The song states a case strongly in favor of laughter, even if Mary Poppins appears to disapprove of Uncle Albert's behavior, especially since it not only complicates the task of getting Albert down, but the infectious mood sends Bert and the Banks children into the air as well.",

            "Amazing Stories\nAmazing Stories is an American science fiction magazine launched in April 1926 by Hugo Gernsback's Experimenter Publishing. It was the first magazine devoted solely to science fiction. Science fiction stories had made regular appearances in other magazines, including some published by Gernsback, but \"Amazing\" helped define and launch a new genre of pulp fiction.",
            "Amazing Stories Quarterly\nAmazing Stories Quarterly was a U.S. science fiction pulp magazine published from 1928 to 1934. It was launched by Hugo Gernsback as a companion to his \"Amazing Stories\", the first science fiction magazine, which had begun publishing in April 1926. \"Amazing Stories\" had been successful enough for Gernsback to try a single issue of \"Amazing Stories Annual\" in 1927, which had sold well, and he decided to follow it up with a quarterly magazine. The first issue of \"Amazing Stories Quarterly\" was dated Winter 1928 and carried a reprint of H.G. Wells' \"When the Sleeper Wakes\". Gernsback's policy of running a novel in each issue was popular with his readership, though the choice of Wells' novel was less so. Over the next five issues only one more reprint appeared: Gernsback's own novel \"Ralph 124C 41+\", in the Winter 1929 issue. Gernsback went bankrupt in early 1929, and lost control of both \"Amazing Stories\" and \"Amazing Stories Quarterly\"; his assistant, T. O'Conor Sloane, took over as editor. The magazine began to run into financial difficulties in 1932, and the schedule became irregular; the last issue was dated Fall 1934.",

Some clubs include members in all the different aspects of the hobby, while others concentrate on one particularly field, such as cichlids or marine fishkeeping. The first aquarium society ever formed was the \"Gotha Aquarium\" in Germany, founded in 1882. The oldest continuous aquarium club still in existence is the Boston Aquarium Society, founded in 1916. A Brooklyn Aquarium Society in New York City founded in 1911, but disbanded mid-century, and later reformed in the 1950s with the same name.",

Jack Dempsey cichlids are one of about 30 aquarium fish species that have become established in Australian waterways, and have been shown to have a significant impact on Australian aquatic ecosystems.

Like other clownfishes (also known as anemonefishes), it often lives in association with sea anemones. \"A. percula\" is associated specifically with \"Heteractis magnifica\" and \"Stichodactyla gigantea\", and as larva use chemical cues released from the anemones to identify and locate the appropriate host species to use them for shelter and protection. This causes preferential selection when finding their anemone host species. Although popular, maintaining this species in captivity is rather complex. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority regulates the number of collection permits that are issued to aquarium fish dealers who seek this, and other tropical fish within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.",

Four tracks from the album made in into the Billboard top 20 country singles charts, including the #1 \"Blame It on Your Heart\" and the #3 \"How Can I Help You Say Goodbye,\" later covered by Laura Branigan. The #6 hit \"You Will\" was originally recorded by Anne Murray as the title track of her 1990 album. The only single to not make the top ten was the #20 hit \"Nothin' But The Wheel\", considered by many Patty fans to be one of her finest works. The album peaked at #9, and was certified platinum for shipments of over 1,000,000 copies in the U.S. This album was Loveless' first album since she had surgery to repair burst nodes on her vocal cords in 1992.",

This should not be confused with the GloFish , a trademarked brand of fluorescent zebrafish that appear to glow in the dark under ultraviolet light. \"Danio choprai\" is an active danionin species that spends most of its time on mid-water levels. This species feeds on insects that have fallen into the water, aquatic insect larvae, and other small animals. In the aquarium, it accepts most foods offered, including most dry foods. It has a streamlined body marked with a brilliant orange longitudinal band and a series of vertical blue-black bars on the flanks. The fins are edged with yellow. In recent years, it has become quite widely traded as an aquarium fish, but otherwise has no commercial importance. Its common name derives from its similarity to the glowlight tetra, a South American characin only distantly related to this fish.

It was launched by Hugo Gernsback as a companion to his \"Amazing Stories\", the first science fiction magazine, which had begun publishing in April 1926. \"Amazing Stories\" had been successful enough for Gernsback to try a single issue of \"Amazing Stories Annual\" in 1927, which had sold well, and he decided to follow it up with a quarterly magazine. The first issue of \"Amazing Stories Quarterly\" was dated Winter 1928 and carried a reprint of H.G. Wells' \"When the Sleeper Wakes\". Gernsback's policy of running a novel in each issue was popular with his readership, though the choice of Wells' novel was less so. Over the next five issues only one more reprint appeared: Gernsback's own novel \"Ralph 124C 41+\", in the Winter 1929 issue. Gernsback went bankrupt in early 1929, and lost control of both \"Amazing Stories\" and \"Amazing Stories Quarterly\"; his assistant, T. O'Conor Sloane, took over as editor.

Given the right conditions, timbers may survive over long periods of time and a recovered postpipe can simply be of solid wood. Under less preservative conditions however, only a dark circular stain of organic material may be left in the fill of the posthole observable in plan and section. This differs in consistency from the less organic backfill of the posthole and can be identified simply through this change in make-up. The size and depth and of the postpipe can provide information as to any reuse of the posthole especially if several different postpipes can be identified. They can also indicate the species of wood used and help suggest the nature of the structure that the timber once supported. The term was first used by Maud Cunnington when she excavated the site of Woodhenge in the English county of Wiltshire during the 1920s and found numerous examples of decomposed timber posts.",

At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website).
