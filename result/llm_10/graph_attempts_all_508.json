It is an astronomical method of calculating the longitude at which a position line, drawn from a sight by sextant of any celestial body, crosses the observer's assumed latitude. In order to calculate the position line, the time of the sight must be known so that the celestial position i.e. the Greenwich Hour Angle (Celestial Longitude - measured in a westerly direction from Greenwich) and Declination (Celestial Latitude - measured north or south of the equational or celestial equator), of the observed celestial body is known. All that can be derived from a single sight is a single position line, which can be achieved at any time during daylight, when both the sea horizon and the sun are visible. To achieve a fix, more than one celestial body and the sea horizon must be visible. This is usually only possible at dawn and dusk.",

It is one of four shrubs endemic to New Zealand that frequently displays an epiphytic lifestyle. \"P. kirkii\" is commonly epiphytic, perched amongst nest epiphytes in the canopies of emergent or canopy trees in old-growth forest; however, it can be observed occasionally growing on the ground or over rocks (in a rupestral lifestyle). The type locality of \"P. kirkii\" is Great Barrier Island. It was first described by Joseph Dalton Hooker from material collected by Thomas Kirk, published in 1869. The initial brief description titled \"Pittosporum n. sp.?\" by Thomas Kirk was published in his paper on Great Barrier Island in 1868. This description along with herbarium specimens were sent to Dr. J. D Hooker at Kew Gardens in 1868, and he collaborated to name it after T.

The scores from these two events are tallied, and the top three teams advance to the final round on the second day. The final round consists of questions primarily in the style of the National Geographic Bee, as a moderator (since 1993, Alex Trebek) reads questions to one team or one individual at a time.

            "To calculate the geographic point 808 nautical miles northwest of Honolulu, we can use distance and bearing calculations. \n\nFirst, we need to convert the nautical miles to degrees. Since 1 nautical mile is approximately equal to 1 minute of latitude, we can divide 808 nautical miles by 60 to get 13.47 degrees of latitude.\n\nNext, we can use the initial coordinates of Honolulu (21.3069\u00b0 N, 157.8583\u00b0 W) and the calculated distance and bearing to find the new coordinates. \n\nUsing the formula:\nlat2 = asin(sin(lat1)*cos(d/R) + cos(lat1)*sin(d/R)*cos(\u03b8))\nlon2 = lon1 + atan2(sin(\u03b8)*sin(d/R)*cos(lat1), cos(d/R)-sin(lat1)*sin(lat2))\n\nWhere:\nlat1 = 21.3069\u00b0 (initial latitude)\nlon1 = 157.8583\u00b0 (initial longitude)\nd = 808 nautical miles\nR = radius of the Earth (assumed to be 3440 nautical miles)\n\u03b8 = 315\u00b0 (northwest direction)\n\nBy plugging in these values, we can calculate the new coordinates. \n\nAfter performing the calculations, the new coordinates are approximately 34.777\u00b0 N latitude and 142.383\u00b0 W longitude. Therefore, the geographic point 808 nautical miles northwest of Honolulu is at approximately 34.777\u00b0 N latitude and 142.383\u00b0 W longitude.",

            "To calculate the geographical point located 808 nautical miles northwest of Honolulu, we can use the Haversine formula to calculate the new coordinates. \n\nFirst, we convert the distance from nautical miles to kilometers, as 1 nautical mile is approximately equal to 1.852 kilometers. So, 808 nautical miles is approximately 1496.816 kilometers.\n\nNext, we can use the Haversine formula to calculate the new coordinates. The Haversine formula is:\n\na = sin\u00b2(\u0394lat/2) + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin\u00b2(\u0394long/2)\nc = 2 * atan2( \u221aa, \u221a(1\u2212a) )\nd = R * c\n\nWhere:\n- lat1 and long1 are the coordinates of Honolulu (21.3069\u00b0 N latitude and 157.8583\u00b0 W longitude)\n- \u0394lat and \u0394long are the changes in latitude and longitude\n- R is the radius of the Earth (mean radius = 6,371km)\n\nUsing the formula, we can calculate the new coordinates by solving for lat2 and long2:\n\nlat2 = asin( sin(lat1) * cos(d/R) + cos(lat1) * sin(d/R) * cos(\u03b8) )\nlong2 = long1 + atan2(sin(\u03b8) * sin(d/R) * cos(lat1), cos(d/R) \u2212 sin(lat1) * sin(lat2))\n\nWhere:\n- \u03b8 is the bearing (in this case, northwest which is 315 degrees)\n\nBy plugging in the values and solving the equations, we can find the new coordinates located 808 nautical miles northwest of Honolulu.",

The type locality of \"P. kirkii\" is Great Barrier Island. It was first described by Joseph Dalton Hooker from material collected by Thomas Kirk, published in 1869. The initial brief description titled \"Pittosporum n. sp.?\" by Thomas Kirk was published in his paper on Great Barrier Island in 1868. This description along with herbarium specimens were sent to Dr. J. D Hooker at Kew Gardens in 1868, and he collaborated to name it after T.

It is an astronomical method of calculating the longitude at which a position line, drawn from a sight by sextant of any celestial body, crosses the observer's assumed latitude. In order to calculate the position line, the time of the sight must be known so that the celestial position i.e. the Greenwich Hour Angle (Celestial Longitude - measured in a westerly direction from Greenwich) and Declination (Celestial Latitude - measured north or south of the equational or celestial equator), of the observed celestial body is known. All that can be derived from a single sight is a single position line, which can be achieved at any time during daylight, when both the sea horizon and the sun are visible. To achieve a fix, more than one celestial body and the sea horizon must be visible. This is usually only possible at dawn and dusk.",
