            "Midnite Movies\nMidnite Movies is a line of B movies released first on VHS and later on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment. The line was begun by MGM in March 2001 following its acquisition of Orion Pictures, which bought out Filmways, the owner of American International Pictures. AIP had a library of B movies from the 1950s and 1960s that were science fiction, horror, and exploitation films. The \"Midnite Movies\" collection is primarily derived from the AIP library (including most of Roger Corman's and Vincent Price's horror movies) but also included Hammer Film Productions, Amicus Productions, United Artists, and Empire International Pictures movies as well. The DVDs were first released as single films but most later releases would be double features on single double-sided discs. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment later became owners of the MGM library and continued the \"Midnite Movies\" line with distributor 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. All double feature titles released on the 20th Century Fox label were two-disc packages. By 2011, no new titles were forthcoming; the previous catalog titles slowly went out of print and the \"Midnite Movies\" website was taken down.",

This involves a retrieval step where we gather information about the cast members of this film.\n\n2. **Node 2:** Next, for each identified star from the movie, we retrieve their birth dates. This means finding biographical data for each cast member.\n\n3. **Node 3:** The final step involves reasoning, where we compare the retrieved birth dates to find out which actor's birth date matches April 20, 1949. This is a simple matching operation that concludes the task.\n\nThe graph is structured in such a way that the answer can be deduced by systematically narrowing down from the full cast list to identifying birth dates and then performing a final comparison to isolate the correct individual."

So named for the Japanese word \"nagisa\" (\"where the land meets the sea\"), it is an Apronym. NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",
