She was launched as an adult actress in Arabinda Mukhopadhyay's Bengali flick \"Nadi Theke Sagare\" (1978). In 1980, Tarun Majumdar cast her in his romantic flick \"Dadar Kirti\" which literally made her a star. She acted in Aparna Sen's directorial debut 36 Chowringhee Lane (1981). She appeared in Hindi films like Kanak Mishra's \"Jiyo To Aise Jiyo\" (1981), Desh Gautam's \"Bura Aadmi\" (1982), Kovelamudi Raghavendra Rao's \"Justice Chaudhury\" (1983), Mukul Dutt's \"Phulwari\" (1984), Akash Jain's \"Seepeeyan\" (1984), Vijay Singh's \"Kabhi Ajnabi The\" (1985), Bhabendra Nath Saikia's \"Kaal Sandhya\" (1997).
