It usually appears as a part of \"The Krusty the Clown Show\", watched regularly by Bart Simpson and Lisa Simpson. Itself an animated cartoon, \"The Itchy & Scratchy Show\" depicts a sadistic anthropomorphic blue mouse, Itchy (voiced by Dan Castellaneta), who repeatedly maims and kills an anthropomorphic, hapless threadbare black cat, Scratchy (voiced by Harry Shearer). The cartoon first appeared in \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" short \"The Bart Simpson Show\", which originally aired November 20, 1988. The cartoon's first appearance in \"The Simpsons\" was in the 1990 episode \"There's No Disgrace Like Home\". Typically presented as 15-to-60-second-long cartoons, the show is filled with gratuitous violence. \"The Simpsons\" also occasionally features characters who are involved with the production of \"The Itchy & Scratchy Show\", including Roger Meyers Jr. (voiced by Alex Rocco, and, later, Hank Azaria), who runs the studio and produces the show."
