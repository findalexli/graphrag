            "Owner earnings refers to the amount of money that a company's owner can take out of the business for personal use, while still leaving enough capital in the business to operate and grow. It is calculated by taking the company's net income, adding back non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, and subtracting any capital expenditures and working capital needs. This provides a more accurate picture of the cash flow available to the owner.\n\nThe components or activities associated with owner earnings include:\n1. Calculating net income: This involves determining the company's total revenue and subtracting all expenses to arrive at the net income.\n2. Adding back non-cash expenses: Non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization are added back to the net income, as they do not represent actual cash outflows.\n3. Subtracting capital expenditures: Capital expenditures, which are investments in long-term assets, are subtracted from the adjusted net income to account for the cash used for these investments.\n4. Subtracting working capital needs: Working capital needs, such as inventory and accounts receivable, are also subtracted from the adjusted net income to ensure that enough cash is left in the business for day-to-day operations.\n\nOverall, owner earnings provide a more realistic measure of the cash flow available to the owner of a business, taking into account both the profitability and the capital needs of the company.",

            "Only What I Feel\nOnly What I Feel is the sixth album, and the first since signing with Epic Records in 1992, recorded by country music artist Patty Loveless. It was released in 1993. Four tracks from the album made in into the Billboard top 20 country singles charts, including the #1 \"Blame It on Your Heart\" and the #3 \"How Can I Help You Say Goodbye,\" later covered by Laura Branigan. The #6 hit \"You Will\" was originally recorded by Anne Murray as the title track of her 1990 album. The only single to not make the top ten was the #20 hit \"Nothin' But The Wheel\", considered by many Patty fans to be one of her finest works. The album peaked at #9, and was certified platinum for shipments of over 1,000,000 copies in the U.S. This album was Loveless' first album since she had surgery to repair burst nodes on her vocal cords in 1992."

This valuation method is used to determine the value of a company. It is a key factor in assessing the financial health and potential of a business.",

Net cash flows: This includes the cash generated from the business operations, such as sales revenue, and subtracts any cash expenses, such as operating expenses and taxes. This represents the actual cash that the business is generating.\n\n2. Reinvestment of earnings: This refers to the amount of cash that the business needs to reinvest in order to maintain or grow its operations. This can include capital expenditures, research and development, and other investments in the business.\n\n3. Life of the business: Owner earnings take into account the expected cash flows over the entire lifespan of the business, rather than just focusing on short-term profits. This long-term perspective is important for assessing the sustainability and potential of the business.\n\nOverall, owner earnings provide a comprehensive view of the cash flows and reinvestment needs of a business, which is essential for determining its value and financial health.",
            "Warren Buffett is a renowned investor known for his investment principles and financial activities. He is a proponent of value investing, as outlined in the book \"The Warren Buffett Way\" by Robert Hagstrom. Buffett's investment philosophy focuses on long-term value creation and the importance of understanding the intrinsic value of a company before investing. He is also known for his control over investments and his preference for separately managed accounts, which offer flexibility and customization for clients.\n\nIn addition to his investment principles, Buffett has been involved in international business, conducting trades and investments across different countries. His financial activities have made him a prominent figure in the investment management industry, and he has been a part of senior management teams in various organizations.\n\nIt is important to note that \"Warren Hound\" refers to a group of Mediterranean hare-hunting dogs and \"The Carlyle Group\" is an American multinational private equity and financial services corporation, which are unrelated to Warren Buffett's investment principles and financial activities.

Both 'Owner earnings' and Warren Buffett's financial activities emphasize the importance of long-term value creation and understanding the intrinsic value of a company before making investment decisions. Additionally, both concepts consider the reinvestment of earnings and the sustainability of cash flows over the lifespan of a business. This suggests that Warren Buffett's financial activities align with the principles of owner earnings, emphasizing the importance of cash flows, reinvestment, and long-term value creation in assessing the financial health and potential of a business."

At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website).

The code is normally based on information provided to HMRC by the taxpayer or their employer. Tax codes are usually adjusted once a year to take into account any changes made in the National Budget, but can be altered more often to reflect an employee's circumstances. Tax codes can be changed if someone has paid too much or too little tax the previous tax year, if an employee receives state benefits, or has non-PAYE income (for example, self-employed earnings). Changes in a tax code are to ensure the employee has paid the correct amount of tax by the end of each tax year.",

MOM will also contain information which our society is obliged to forward to the future: e.g. description of nuclear waste repositories. MOM collaborates with the NEA and SKB. Although the most obvious ambition and often described in the media is the concern about preserving our knowledge, this is not the primary goal of MOM. Serving as a time capsule MOM is both: in a time frame of millennia it is the story about us, and in a time frame of decades it is a backup. In times where global warming, nuclear danger and biological warfare threaten the existence of civilization, saving the core knowledge and culture acquired over centuries is a backup measure. In case of a collapse, the MOM project could help survivors to rebuild civilization. Linked to this, an another reason is of political order: facing the lack of reactivity of authorities concerning global warming, the MOM project is a reminder of what can happen. Roman and Greek civilizations whose histories have been reconstructed by the small percentage of texts and artifacts which survived until our days are examples that have inspired the MOM project. Finally, it's a critic of our digital civilization : according to Kunze, maybe nothing of the 21st century will last in the future, since most of our interactions are now virtual. The \"accuracy versus bullshit\" is one of the main themes of the MOM project, worried about loss of information, the project can only aim to save a fragment of the information produced until today, but this fragment has to be representative.",

The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species. The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy. Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included. Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures. This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it. If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views. When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others. You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances. According to Gannon: \"How you treat others will determine how others treat you. How others treat you will determine how you see yourself. How you see yourself will determine who you are.\""
