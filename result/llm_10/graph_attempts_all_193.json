            "Joseph-Martin Cabirol\nJoseph-Martin Cabirol was a French man. In 1855 he patented a new model of standard diving dress in Paris, mainly from Augustus Siebe's designs, and afterwards he made them. The suit is made out of rubberized canvas. The helmet, for the first time, includes a hand-controlled tap that the diver uses to evacuate his exhaled air. The tap includes a safety valve which stops water from entering the helmet. Until 1855 diving helmets were equipped with only three circular windows (front, left and right sides). Cabirol's helmet introduced the later well known fourth window, in the upper front part of the helmet and letting the diver watch above him. Having been presented to the \"Exposition Universelle\" in Paris Cabirol's diving dress won the silver medal. This original diving dress and helmet are now preserved at the \"Conservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers\" in Paris.",

Tax codes can be changed if someone has paid too much or too little tax the previous tax year, if an employee receives state benefits, or has non-PAYE income (for example, self-employed earnings). Changes in a tax code are to ensure the employee has paid the correct amount of tax by the end of each tax year.",
