            "International business\nInternational business comprises all international trades services or investments (bonds, stocks) conducted by both the private and public sectors that take place between two or more countries beyond their political boundaries. The term \"international business\" refers to all those business activities which involve cross-border transactions of goods, services, and resources between two or more nations. Transactions of economic resources include capital, skills, people for the purpose of the international production of physical goods and services such as finance, banking, insurance, and construction. International business can also be referred to as globalization. Globalization is the shift toward a more integrated and interdependent economy. In order to conduct business overseas, multinational companies need to separate national markets into one huge global marketplace. Two macro factors underline the trend of greater globalization. The first is falling of barriers to make cross-border trade easier such as the free flow of goods and services, and capital, and the second factor is technological change, particularly the developments in communication, information processing, and transportation technologies.",

Sanheyuan have structures on three sides of a courtyard, forming an inverted U-shape, resembling the Chinese character \u51f9 (pinyin: \"\u0101o\"). There is normally a wall linking the two forward-thrusting side wings, called \u5ec2\u623f (pinyin: \"xi\u0101ngf\u00e1ng\"), similar to the wings of a siheyuan. Sanheyuan may be square or rectangular shaped and can be single or multiple-story structures. Typically there are three structural divisions within the horizontal building in the U, which is called a \"three-jian\" building (Chinese: \u4e09\u9593\u5c4b; pinyin: \"s\u0101nji\u0101nw\u016b\").

When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features.

            "Memory of Mankind\nSeveral motivations underlie the project. The primary ambition of MOM is to preserve an image of our era, created by numerous participants all over the planet. MOM will also contain information which our society is obliged to forward to the future: e.g. description of nuclear waste repositories. MOM collaborates with the NEA and SKB. Although the most obvious ambition and often described in the media is the concern about preserving our knowledge, this is not the primary goal of MOM. Serving as a time capsule MOM is both: in a time frame of millennia it is the story about us, and in a time frame of decades it is a backup. In times where global warming, nuclear danger and biological warfare threaten the existence of civilization, saving the core knowledge and culture acquired over centuries is a backup measure. In case of a collapse, the MOM project could help survivors to rebuild civilization. Linked to this, an another reason is of political order: facing the lack of reactivity of authorities concerning global warming, the MOM project is a reminder of what can happen. Roman and Greek civilizations whose histories have been reconstructed by the small percentage of texts and artifacts which survived until our days are examples that have inspired the MOM project. Finally, it's a critic of our digital civilization : according to Kunze, maybe nothing of the 21st century will last in the future, since most of our interactions are now virtual. The \"accuracy versus bullshit\" is one of the main themes of the MOM project, worried about loss of information, the project can only aim to save a fragment of the information produced until today, but this fragment has to be representative.",

These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website).
