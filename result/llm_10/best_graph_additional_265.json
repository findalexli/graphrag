Bob's twin brother Richard was never the road manager, although this misinformation appears in several places on the internet. The band's road manager was Richard 'Biggie' Korn. When the group expanded to its full family membership by 1967, the six siblings ranged in age from 8 to 19. Joined by their mother, Barbara Cowsill (n\u00e9e Russell), the group was the inspiration for the 1970s television show \"The Partridge Family\".",
