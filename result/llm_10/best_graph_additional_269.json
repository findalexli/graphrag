            "Silicon boride\nSilicon borides (also known as boron silicides) are lightweight ceramic compounds formed between silicon and boron. Several stoichiometric silicon boride compounds, SiB, have been reported: silicon triboride, SiB, silicon tetraboride, SiB, silicon hexaboride, SiB, as well as SiB (\"n\" = 14, 15, 40, etc.). The \"n\" = 3 and \"n\" = 6 phases were reported as being co-produced together as a mixture for the first time by Henri Moissan and Alfred Stock in 1900 by briefly heating silicon and boron in a clay vessel. The tetraboride was first reported as being synthesized directly from the elements in 1960 by three independent groups: Carl Cline and Donald Sands; Ervin Colton; and Cyrill Brosset and Bengt Magnusson. It has been proposed that the triboride is a silicon-rich version of the tetraboride. Hence, the stoichiometry of either compound could be expressed as SiB where \"x\" = 0 or 1. All the silicon borides are black, crystalline materials of similar density: 2.52 and 2.47 g cm, respectively, for the \"n\" = 3(4) and 6 compounds. On the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, SiB and SiB are intermediate between diamond (10) and ruby (9). The silicon borides may be grown from boron-saturated silicon in either the solid or liquid state.",

            "Silicon boride\nSilicon borides (also known as boron silicides) are lightweight ceramic compounds formed between silicon and boron. Several stoichiometric silicon boride compounds, SiB, have been reported: silicon triboride, SiB, silicon tetraboride, SiB, silicon hexaboride, SiB, as well as SiB (\"n\" = 14, 15, 40, etc.). The \"n\" = 3 and \"n\" = 6 phases were reported as being co-produced together as a mixture for the first time by Henri Moissan and Alfred Stock in 1900 by briefly heating silicon and boron in a clay vessel. The tetraboride was first reported as being synthesized directly from the elements in 1960 by three independent groups: Carl Cline and Donald Sands; Ervin Colton; and Cyrill Brosset and Bengt Magnusson. It has been proposed that the triboride is a silicon-rich version of the tetraboride. Hence, the stoichiometry of either compound could be expressed as SiB where \"x\" = 0 or 1. All the silicon borides are black, crystalline materials of similar density: 2.52 and 2.47 g cm, respectively, for the \"n\" = 3(4) and 6 compounds. On the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, SiB and SiB are intermediate between diamond (10) and ruby (9). The silicon borides may be grown from boron-saturated silicon in either the solid or liquid state.",
