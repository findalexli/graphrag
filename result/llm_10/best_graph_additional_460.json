As a result of mine development at Mount Pleasant, Route 785 was heavily developed and rerouted from the original stage coach trail. Another name for the road is the \"Sheldon Lee Highway\", a satirical reference to former New Brunswick Minister of Transportation, Hon. Sheldon Lee, who continued developed the road during his terms in office, especially on the portion of road north of Mount Pleasant. Mr. Lee lived in the community of Bonny River, which is located near the southern end of Route 785, and likely many people today, frequently used the Route 785 for travel to Fredericton from the St. George area. Today, the road is heavily used by forest operations.",
