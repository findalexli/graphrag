            "Claiming race\nA claiming race in thoroughbred horse racing is one in which the horses are all for sale for more or less the same price (the \"claiming price\") up until shortly before the race. Race types form a hierarchy in terms of the quality of horse they attract, with handicap races and graded stakes races attracting the \"best\" horses and maiden races the most unseasoned. Claiming races fall at the bottom of this hierarchy, below maiden races, and make up the bulk of races run at most US tracks. For example in Kentucky in 1999, 54% of all races run were claiming races, but had only 20% of the purse dollar value, the lowest average purse among race types.",

            "Horse Racing (video game)\nHorse Racing is an equestrian video game released by Mattel Electronics for its Intellivision video game console in 1980. Although primarily a sports video game, \"Horse Racing\" was actually assigned to the Gaming Network, due to its pari-mutuel betting for placing bets on the horses during the game; the game houses 8 virtual Thoroughbred race horses residing in the fictional \"Rainbow Thoroughbred Stables\" at a fictional western Kentucky race track called \"Plympton Downs\" (based loosely on long-time sportscaster/Intellivision sales personality George Plimpton). Each of the horses have differing racing abilities (front runner, pace keeper, come from behind, ...), and do vary from game time to game time (a horse with come from behind traits during one match may have front runner abilities during the next match). These horses are known by their colors (instead of their post position numbers\u2014unlike in regular horse racing).",
