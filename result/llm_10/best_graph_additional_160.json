            "Asiatosuchus\nAsiatosuchus is an extinct genus of crocodyloid crocodilians that lived in Eurasia during the Paleogene. Many Paleogene crocodilians from Europe and Asia have been attributed to \"Asiatosuchus\" since the genus was named in 1940. These species have a generalized crocodilian morphology typified by flat, triangular skulls.
