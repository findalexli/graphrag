            "Conospermum\nConospermum is a genus of about 50 species in the family Proteaceae that are endemic to Australia. Members of the genus are known as smokebushes - from a distance, their wispy heads of blue or grey flowers resemble puffs of smoke. They have an unusual pollination method that sometimes leads to the death of visiting insects. They are found in all Australian states, though most occur only in Western Australia. Smokebushes are rarely cultivated, though the flowers of several Western Australian species are harvested for the cut flower industry.",
            "Nemegtomaia\nNemegtomaia is a genus of oviraptorid dinosaur from what is now Mongolia that lived in the Late Cretaceous Period, about 70million years ago. The first specimen was found in 1996, and became the basis of the new genus and species N. barsboldi in 2004. The original genus name was \"Nemegtia\", but this was changed to \"Nemegtomaia\" in 2005, as the former name was preoccupied. The first part of the generic name refers to the Nemegt Basin, where the animal was found, and the second part means \"good mother\", in reference to the fact that oviraptorids are known to have brooded their eggs. The specific name honours the palaeontologist Rinchen Barsbold. Two more specimens were found in 2007, one of which was found on top of a nest with eggs, but the dinosaur had received its genus name before it was found associated with eggs.",

In 2010, Zuloaga, Scataglini, & Morrone proposed the transfer of the \"Panicum\" sections \"Agrostoidea\" and \"Tenera\" to the new genus, \"Sorengia\". However, that same year, because one of the new species' synonyms was in the valid \"Coleataenia\" genus, Robert J. Soreng determined that \"Sorengia\" was not a valid name for the new genus and re-published it as \"Coleataenia\".",
