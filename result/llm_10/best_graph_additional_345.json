The ranch house, called Shackford, was built in 1896; its uncommon style resembles a bungalow but also borrows from other styles such as the Stick style. By 1906, the \"Fargo Forum\" described the ranch as \"the biggest and most important [ranch] in the state\" and \"one of the largest horse raising outlets in the world\". In the same year, Hidekoper sold the 70,000 acre ranch; the sale was the largest land deal in North Dakota history.
