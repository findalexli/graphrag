Another step is identifying the sequel relationships among Carroll's works (Node 4).

            "The novel by Lewis Carroll that features the Red Queen's race is \"Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There\" (1871). This is the sequel to \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and includes the incident of the Red Queen and Alice constantly running but remaining in the same spot.",
            "The science fiction short story titled 'The Red Queen's Race' was written by Isaac Asimov. It was first published in the January 1949 issue of \"Astounding Science Fiction\" and reprinted in the 1972 collection \"The Early Asimov\".",
            "The novel \"Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There\" by Lewis Carroll does not have any direct sequels. However, it is part of the larger \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" series, which includes various adaptations, spin-offs, and references in popular culture, such as the 2010 film \"Alice in Wonderland\" and the science fiction short story \"The Red Queen's Race\" by Isaac Asimov. Additionally, there is a young adult fantasy novel series called \"Red Queen\" by Victoria Aveyard, which has sequels titled \"Glass Sword\" and \"King's Cage\", but it is not directly related to Lewis Carroll's work.",
            "There is no direct sequel to the novel \"Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There\" by Lewis Carroll.",
            "The Red Queen's race in the science fiction short story \"The Red Queen's Race\" by Isaac Asimov is not directly related to the race from the novel \"Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There\" by Lewis Carroll. The two works are separate and unrelated."
