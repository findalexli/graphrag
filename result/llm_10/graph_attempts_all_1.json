Pearson said of her decision to write her book, \"I just want to let people know where I came from ... to share my story. I know the Lord has blessed me. He gave me the power just to tell this story.\" The book also depicts the difficulty with which Pearson attempts to adjust to life after prison; she is fired from two jobs due to her criminal background, which drives her to return temporarily to drug dealing.

            "Antisemitism in the Soviet Union\nThe 1917 Russian Revolution overthrew a centuries-old regime of official antisemitism in the Russian Empire. The success of the Soviet Union in dealing with this previous legacy of antisemitism, as well as the extent that the Soviet government fought against this prejudice, is a topic of some debate. Although officially forbidden as a form of ethnic and racial chauvinism, antisemitism came to be commonly used as an instrument for personal conflicts in the Soviet Union, starting from conflict between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky (who was Jewish) and continuing through numerous conspiracy theories spread by official Stalinist propaganda. Antisemitism in the Soviet Union reached new heights after 1948 during the campaign against the \"rootless cosmopolitan\", in which numerous Yiddish-writing poets, writers, painters and sculptors were killed or arrested. This culminated in the so-called Doctors' plot, in which a group of doctors (some of whom were Jewish) had allegedly conspired to murder Stalin.",

            "I Love to Laugh\n\"I Love to Laugh\", also called \"We Love to Laugh\", is a song from Walt Disney's film \"Mary Poppins\". It was composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. The song is sung in the film by \"Uncle Albert\" (Ed Wynn), and \"Bert\" (Dick Van Dyke) as they levitate uncontrollably toward the ceiling, eventually joined by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) herself. The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can \"lighten\" a mood. (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.) Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors \"down to earth\" again. The song states a case strongly in favor of laughter, even if Mary Poppins appears to disapprove of Uncle Albert's behavior, especially since it not only complicates the task of getting Albert down, but the infectious mood sends Bert and the Banks children into the air as well.",

It covers an area of some 9 square km and is the westernmost populated island in Estonia. The surrounding waters are shallow and rocky and many ships travelling the Baltic have perished nearby. The island of Vilsandi can be reached by boat, by truck having suitable clearance or on foot by wading from Saaremaa. Much of the island is now part of Vilsandi National Park, which grew from a bird reserve founded in 1910. It is a highly sensitive ecosystem due to the use of the area by many migratory birds as a breeding and nesting ground. Hunting is absolutely prohibited. This park is a popular tourist destination not only for local Estonians, but also people of Finland who are visiting Estonia in greater and greater numbers.",
            "Silvio Dante\nSilvio Manfred Dante, played by Steven Van Zandt, is a fictional character on the HBO TV series \"The Sopranos\". He is the consigliere to Tony Soprano in the Soprano crime family. He is usually a behind-the-scenes figure and tries not to draw much attention to himself. He does very well at maintaining the image of a legitimate businessman as the manager and owner of the Bada Bing strip club. Silvio usually keeps his cool in even the worst situations but has been known to reveal his temper when necessary (or when playing poker). Silvio is a movie and film connoisseur and has an encyclopedic mind for movie lines. Throughout the series, he entertains the other family members by request with lukewarm Godfather impressions, mimicking Michael Corleone's remark in \"The Godfather Part III\": \"Just when I thought I was out...they pulled me back in.\" Silvio is one of the most loyal mobsters in the Soprano crime family.",
            "Headache (game)\nHeadache is a board game similar to the traditional game \"Mensch \u00e4rgere dich nicht\", in which the object is to land a playing piece on top of all opponents' pieces (known as \"cones\"). The game is distinct from \"Mensch \u00e4rgere dich nicht\" in that there is no finish the player must reach. Play moves in circles, until only one player has cones remaining on the board, being declared the winner. All players are welcome to occupy any space throughout the game, provided the die rolls allow, and there are eight spaces that serve as \"safe\" spots, where a cone resting on this space cannot be captured. Captured pieces are not sent back to start, but are permanently lost.",
            "Citrus greening disease\nCitrus greening disease (; or HLB), is a disease of citrus caused by a vector-transmitted pathogen. The causative agents are motile bacteria, \"Candidatus\" Liberibacter spp. The disease is vectored and transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid, \"Diaphorina citri\", and the African citrus psyllid, \"Trioza erytreae\", also known as the two-spotted citrus psyllid. It has also been shown to be graft-transmissible. Three different types of HLB are currently known: The heat-tolerant Asian form, and the heat-sensitive African and American forms. The disease was first described in 1929 and first reported in China in 1943. The African variation was first reported in 1947 in South Africa, where it is still widespread. Eventually, it affected the United states, reaching Florida in 2005. Within three years, it had spread to the majority of citrus farms. The rapid increase in this disease has threatened the citrus industry not only in Florida, but the entire US. As of 2009, 33 countries have reported HLB infection in their citrus crop.",

They fought the war on two fronts: the southern border of Acadia, which New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine.
