            "Imagine (John Lennon album)\nImagine is the second studio album by John Lennon. Recorded and released in 1971, the album is more heavily produced in contrast to the basic, raw arrangements of his previous album, the critically acclaimed \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\".",
            "How? (song)\n\"How?\" is a song from John Lennon's second solo album \"Imagine\", released in 1971. It is a contemplative song inspired by the Primal Therapy he was undergoing with his wife Yoko Ono, during which he faced many personal questions such as \"How can I go forward when I don't know which way I'm facing?\" This song also shows his thoughts about the world in general (such as \"And the World is so tough; Sometimes I feel I've had enough\").",
            "Isolation (John Lennon song)\n\"Isolation\" is a 1970 song appearing on John Lennon's first official solo album release, \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\". It ends side one of the album, and is the fifth track. In the Philippines Apple Records released \"Isolation\" as the b-side to \"Mother\", the single off \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\", in contrast to most countries where the b-side was Yoko Ono's \"Why.\" It was also released on an EP in Mexico along with \"Mother,\" \"Look at Me'\" and \"My Mummy's Dead.\"",
            "I'm Losing You (John Lennon song)\n\"I'm Losing You\" is a song written by John Lennon and released on his 1980 album \"Double Fantasy\". It was completed in Bermuda in June 1980, after Lennon failed at an attempted telephone call to Yoko Ono. The song is also available on the 1982 compilation \"The John Lennon Collection\", the 1998 boxset \"John Lennon Anthology\", the one disc compilation \"Wonsaponatime\", the 2005 two disc compilation \"\" and in 2010 for the \"Gimme Some Truth\" album. The song was also featured in the 2005 musical \"Lennon\".",
            "Life Begins at 40 (song)\n\"Life Begins at 40\" is a song by John Lennon. It was written in 1980, the year that both Lennon and Ringo Starr turned 40 years of age. Lennon recorded a demo of the song at his home, but it was not recorded at any of the sessions for his comeback album, \"Double Fantasy.\" Instead, he intended to give the song to Starr to record on his own forthcoming album, \"Can't Fight Lightning.\" The song's amiable country feel was well suited to Starr's singing style. After Lennon's murder in December 1980, those plans were shelved. However, Lennon's demo was eventually issued in 1998 on the \"John Lennon Anthology\" box set.",
            "Hold On (John Lennon song)\n\"Hold On\" is a song from the album \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" by John Lennon. It features only vocals, tremolo guitar, drums, and bass guitar, typical of the sparse arrangements Lennon favoured at the time. On the 2000 reissue of \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\", \"Hold On\" features a slightly longer introduction. The original version was restored on the 2010 reissue.",
            "Rock 'n' Roll (John Lennon album)\nRock 'n' Roll is the sixth studio album by John Lennon. Released in 1975, it is an album of late 1950s and early 1960s songs as covered by Lennon. Recording the album was problematic and spanned an entire year: Phil Spector produced sessions in October 1973 at A&M Studios, and Lennon produced sessions in October 1974 at Record Plant Studios (East). Lennon was being sued by Morris Levy over copyright infringement of one line in his song \"Come Together\". As part of an agreement, Lennon had to include three Levy-owned songs on \"Rock 'n' Roll\". Spector disappeared with the session recordings and was subsequently involved in a motor accident, leaving the album's tracks unrecoverable until the beginning of the \"Walls and Bridges\" sessions. With \"Walls and Bridges\" coming out first, featuring one Levy-owned song, Levy sued Lennon expecting to see Lennon's \"Rock 'n' Roll\" album.",
            "Milk and Honey (album)\nMilk and Honey is an album by John Lennon and Yoko Ono released in 1984. Following the compilation \"The John Lennon Collection\", it is Lennon's eighth and final studio album, and the first posthumous release of new Lennon music, having been recorded in the last months of his life during and following the sessions for their 1980 album \"Double Fantasy\". It was assembled by Yoko Ono in association with the Geffen label.",
            "Come Together\n\"Come Together\" is a song by the Beatles written primarily by John Lennon and credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. The song is the opening track on the album \"Abbey Road\" and was also released as a single coupled with \"Something\".

            "Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon\nLennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon is the third official compilation album of John Lennon's solo career, coming after 1975's \"Shaved Fish\" and 1982's \"The John Lennon Collection\". Because neither collection spanned Lennon's releases up to and including 1984's \"Milk and Honey\", \"Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon\" \u2013 considered the definitive Lennon retrospective \u2013 was compiled to rectify the situation. It was released in the UK in 1997 through Parlophone and early 1998 in the US by EMI Records.",
