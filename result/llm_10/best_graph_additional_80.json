            "Prince Hamlet\nPrince Hamlet is the title character and protagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Hamlet\". He is the Prince of Denmark, nephew to the usurping Claudius, and son of King Hamlet, the previous King of Denmark. At the beginning of the play, he struggles with whether, and how, to avenge the murder of his father, and struggles with his own sanity along the way. By the end of the tragedy, Hamlet has caused the deaths of Polonius, Laertes, Claudius, and two acquaintances of his from the University of Wittenberg Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. He is also indirectly involved in the deaths of his love Ophelia (drowning) and of his mother Gertrude (poisoned by Claudius by mistake).",
            "Horatio (Hamlet)\nHoratio is a character in William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Hamlet\". Horatio's origins are unknown, although he was present on the battlefield when Hamlet's father defeated 'the ambitious Norway', Fortinbras (the king), and attended Wittenberg University with Prince Hamlet. Horatio is evidently not directly involved in the intrigue at the Danish court; thus, he makes a good foil or sounding board for Prince Hamlet. He is often not identified as any specific court position, but simply as \"friend to Hamlet.\"",
            "Hamlet\nThe Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, often shortened to Hamlet ( ), is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare at an uncertain date between 1599 and 1602. Set in Denmark, the play dramatises the revenge Prince Hamlet is called to wreak upon his uncle, Claudius, by the ghost of Hamlet's father, King Hamlet. Claudius had murdered his own brother and seized the throne, also marrying his deceased brother's widow.",
            "Fratricide Punished\nFratricide Punished, or \"The Tragedy of Fratricide Punished: or Prince Hamlet of Denmark\", is the English name of a German-language play of anonymous origins and disputed age. Due to similarities of plot and dramatis personae, it is considered to be a German variant of the English play \"Hamlet\", though possibly not William Shakespeare\u2019s \"Hamlet\", and is a problematic figure in discussions of Hamlet Q1 and the so-called Ur-Hamlet. Such discussions have helped to raise interest in the text, which primarily lived in obscurity before the discovery of Q1 in 1823. \"Fratricide Punished\" was first published in German from a written manuscript in 1781 and translated to English by Georgina Archer in 1865. Though the play is readily available online both in English and in German, the manuscript has been lost since its initial publication, and all subsequent editions of the text are, as such, at a remove from the original. \"Fratricide Punished\" is often referred to by its German title \"Der Bestrafte Brudermord,\" or \"Tragoedia der bestrafte Bruder-mord oder: Prinz Hamlet aus D\u00e4nnemark.\""
