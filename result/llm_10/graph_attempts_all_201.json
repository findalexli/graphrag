            "Justin Smith Morrill was instrumental in the establishment of land-grant universities in the United States through his advocacy and sponsorship of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act of 1862 and 1890. This act provided federal funding for the creation of public colleges and universities, with a focus on agricultural and technical education. Many institutions, such as Cornell University, the University of Vermont, and South Dakota State University, were able to benefit from this legislation and were designated as land-grant universities. Additionally, Morrill's influence is evident in the naming of academic buildings, such as Morrill Hall at Cornell University and the University of Vermont, in his honor. His impact on higher education is further demonstrated by the continued use of the term \"land-grant university\" to refer to institutions designated to receive the benefits of the Morrill Acts. Furthermore, the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, sponsored by Morrill, also reflects his involvement in federal legislation beyond education.

This legislation led to the establishment of numerous land-grant universities, which have since played a crucial role in providing accessible higher education and promoting research and innovation in agriculture and other technical fields. The act also helped to expand educational opportunities for a broader segment of the population, as it aimed to make higher education more practical and applicable to everyday life. Additionally, the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, also sponsored by Morrill, reflected his involvement in federal legislation beyond education, demonstrating his broader impact on American society.

At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan.

NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",

When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features.

            "A land-grant university is an institution of higher education in the United States that has been designated by a state to receive the benefits of the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890. These acts were passed to support the establishment of institutions that focused on agricultural and mechanical arts education, as well as military tactics. The goal was to make higher education more accessible to a larger segment of the population.\n\nThe Morrill Acts were named after Justin Smith Morrill, a U.S. Senator from Vermont who was the primary proponent of the legislation. The acts provided federal land to the states, which could then be sold or used to generate funds for the establishment of colleges that focused on practical education. This led to the creation of the land-grant universities and colleges that we see today.\n\nThese institutions have a special focus on academic programs in agriculture, engineering, nursing, and pharmacy, as well as the liberal arts. They are also known for their research activities and their commitment to public service. Many land-grant universities have multiple campuses and facilities throughout their respective states, providing education and resources to a wide range of communities.\n\nSome examples of land-grant universities include South Dakota State University, Pennsylvania State University, Ohio State University at Mansfield, University of Vermont, and University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. These institutions have played a significant role in shaping higher education in the United States and continue to be leaders in research, education, and community engagement.",

            "The Smith-Lever Act and the Smith-Morrill Act are two separate pieces of legislation with significant implications for education and land-grant colleges in the United States.\n\nThe Smith-Lever Act, passed in 1914, established a system of cooperative extension services, which provided outreach and education to rural communities through land-grant universities. This act allowed for the dissemination of research-based knowledge and practical information in agriculture, home economics, and related subjects to farmers, homemakers, and youth. The implications of this act were far-reaching, as it helped to improve agricultural practices, increase food production, and enhance the quality of rural life in America.\n\nOn the other hand, the Smith-Morrill Act, also known as the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, was passed in 1862 and provided federal funding for the establishment of public colleges and universities. This act was named after its primary sponsor, Justin Smith Morrill, and it aimed to expand higher education opportunities by creating institutions that focused on agricultural and mechanical arts. The implications of this act were profound, as it led to the founding of numerous land-grant institutions across the country, which played a crucial role in advancing agricultural and technical education.\n\nBoth acts have had a lasting impact on education and rural development in the United States, contributing to the growth and improvement of agricultural practices, the advancement of scientific knowledge, and the accessibility of higher education for a broader segment of the population.",
