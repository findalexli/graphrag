About 40\u00a0km in length, and no more than about 2\u00a0km wide, the lake is primarily significant as the ultimate source of the Mackenzie River. The lake is at the head of the Finlay River, which joins the Peace River via Williston Lake.

The mine is accessed by the Omineca Resource Road and other resource routes, and is 400\u00a0km by road from Prince George. Just downstream from the outlet of Thutade Lake, the Finlay plunges over 180 ft Cascadero Falls, and then through a series of cataracts in a twisting course until it begins its main northeastward trend.
