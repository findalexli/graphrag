In 1855 he patented a new model of standard diving dress in Paris, mainly from Augustus Siebe's designs, and afterwards he made them. The suit is made out of rubberized canvas. The helmet, for the first time, includes a hand-controlled tap that the diver uses to evacuate his exhaled air. The tap includes a safety valve which stops water from entering the helmet. Until 1855 diving helmets were equipped with only three circular windows (front, left and right sides). Cabirol's helmet introduced the later well known fourth window, in the upper front part of the helmet and letting the diver watch above him. Having been presented to the \"Exposition Universelle\" in Paris Cabirol's diving dress won the silver medal.

The operation was initially planned to be executed in conjunction with Operation Overlord, the Allied landing in the Normandy, but the lack of available resources led to a cancellation of the second landing. By July 1944 the landing was reconsidered, as the clogged-up ports in Normandy did not have the capacity to adequately supply the Allied forces. Concurrently, the French High Command pushed for a revival of the operation that would include large numbers of French troops. As a result, the operation was finally approved in July to be executed in August.",

In 1855 he patented a new model of standard diving dress in Paris, mainly from Augustus Siebe's designs, and afterwards he made them. The suit is made out of rubberized canvas. The helmet, for the first time, includes a hand-controlled tap that the diver uses to evacuate his exhaled air. The tap includes a safety valve which stops water from entering the helmet. Until 1855 diving helmets were equipped with only three circular windows (front, left and right sides). Cabirol's helmet introduced the later well known fourth window, in the upper front part of the helmet and letting the diver watch above him. Having been presented to the \"Exposition Universelle\" in Paris Cabirol's diving dress won the silver medal. This original diving dress and helmet are now preserved at the \"Conservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers\" in Paris.",

            "Joseph-Martin Cabirol\nJoseph-Martin Cabirol was a French man. In 1855 he patented a new model of standard diving dress in Paris, mainly from Augustus Siebe's designs, and afterwards he made them. The suit is made out of rubberized canvas. The helmet, for the first time, includes a hand-controlled tap that the diver uses to evacuate his exhaled air. The tap includes a safety valve which stops water from entering the helmet. Until 1855 diving helmets were equipped with only three circular windows (front, left and right sides). Cabirol's helmet introduced the later well known fourth window, in the upper front part of the helmet and letting the diver watch above him. Having been presented to the \"Exposition Universelle\" in Paris Cabirol's diving dress won the silver medal. This original diving dress and helmet are now preserved at the \"Conservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers\" in Paris.",

The Coppergate Helmet, also known as the York Helmet, is one of only six Anglo-Saxon helmets discovered to date and is remarkably well-preserved, holding significant historical and archaeological importance.\n\nBoth helmets contribute to our understanding of Anglo-Saxon society, burial practices, and military history, and help to piece together the story of early medieval England. They also provide valuable insights into the craftsmanship and design of helmets during this period. The significance of these helmets lies in their ability to shed light on the cultural and historical context of the Anglo-Saxon period, and their relationship lies in their shared contribution to our understanding of this important era in history.",

            "Joseph-Martin Cabirol\nJoseph-Martin Cabirol was a French man. In 1855 he patented a new model of standard diving dress in Paris, mainly from Augustus Siebe's designs, and afterwards he made them. The suit is made out of rubberized canvas. The helmet, for the first time, includes a hand-controlled tap that the diver uses to evacuate his exhaled air. The tap includes a safety valve which stops water from entering the helmet. Until 1855 diving helmets were equipped with only three circular windows (front, left and right sides). Cabirol's helmet introduced the later well known fourth window, in the upper front part of the helmet and letting the diver watch above him. Having been presented to the \"Exposition Universelle\" in Paris Cabirol's diving dress won the silver medal. This original diving dress and helmet are now preserved at the \"Conservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers\" in Paris.",
