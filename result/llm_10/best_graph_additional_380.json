When it arrived, they decided to put the new boiler in the new 30 ft by 8 ft \"Jubilee\" instead and they put \"Mary Victoria Greenhow's\" engine in \"Jubilee\" as well. She was launched at the Okanagan Landing shipyard at 3:30 p.m. on September 22, 1887. \"Jubilee\" took about two weeks per round trip on the lake. A gold strike on Granite Creek in the Similkameen River in 1889 created business for \"Jubilee\" and Shorts built a barge to help her. However, the strike didn't last long and the barge was beached. \"Jubilee\" was also short-lived, as she froze in ice at Okanagan Landing during a cold spell in the winter of 1889\u20131890. She sank and in the spring, her machinery was put in Shorts' new barge, \"City of Vernon\". The engine was reinstalled in several more ships, and the retired engine was used in a shingle mill for cutting firewood at Trinity Valley starting in 1906. Finally, Mr. and Mrs. G. H.

            "Mission Chicago\nMission Chicago was a pre-dawn glider-borne combat assault in the American airborne landings in Normandy, made by elements of the 101st Airborne Division on the early morning of June 6, 1944 during the Normandy landings of World War II. It was part of Operation Neptune, the assault portion of the Allied invasion of Normandy, codenamed Operation Overlord. Originally slated to be the main assault for the 101st Airborne Division, the glider operation instead became the first reinforcement mission after the main parachute combat assault, Mission Albany. Because the area of responsibility for the division was in close proximity to Utah Beach, the use of glider reinforcement was limited in scale, with most division support units transported by sea.",

The operation was initially planned to be executed in conjunction with Operation Overlord, the Allied landing in the Normandy, but the lack of available resources led to a cancellation of the second landing. By July 1944 the landing was reconsidered, as the clogged-up ports in Normandy did not have the capacity to adequately supply the Allied forces. Concurrently, the French High Command pushed for a revival of the operation that would include large numbers of French troops.

However, the strike didn't last long and the barge was beached. \"Jubilee\" was also short-lived, as she froze in ice at Okanagan Landing during a cold spell in the winter of 1889\u20131890.
