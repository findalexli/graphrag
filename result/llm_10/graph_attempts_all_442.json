            "Headache (game)\nHeadache is a board game similar to the traditional game \"Mensch \u00e4rgere dich nicht\", in which the object is to land a playing piece on top of all opponents' pieces (known as \"cones\"). The game is distinct from \"Mensch \u00e4rgere dich nicht\" in that there is no finish the player must reach. Play moves in circles, until only one player has cones remaining on the board, being declared the winner. All players are welcome to occupy any space throughout the game, provided the die rolls allow, and there are eight spaces that serve as \"safe\" spots, where a cone resting on this space cannot be captured. Captured pieces are not sent back to start, but are permanently lost."

According to Perkins, his role at Main was to convince leaders of underdeveloped countries to accept substantial development loans for large construction and engineering projects that would primarily help the richest families and local elites, rather than the poor, while making sure that these projects were contracted to U.S. companies. Later these loans would give the U.S. political influence and access to natural resources for U.S. companies. He refers to this as an \"economic hit man.\" Although he states that throughout his career he has always worked for private companies, and suggests a system of corporatocracy and greed, rather than a single conspiracy, he claims the involvement of the National Security Agency (NSA), with whom he had interviewed for a job before joining Main. According to the author, this interview effectively constituted an independent screening which led to his subsequent hiring as an economic hit man by Einar Greve, a vice president of the firm (and alleged NSA liaison).",

            "Sharon Gannon\nSharon Gannon (born July 4, 1951 in Washington, D.C.) is a yoga teacher, animal rights advocate, musician, author, dancer/choreographer and painter. Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century. The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species. The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy. Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included. Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures. This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it. If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views. When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others. You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances. According to Gannon: \"How you treat others will determine how others treat you. How others treat you will determine how you see yourself. How you see yourself will determine who you are.\"",

The code is normally based on information provided to HMRC by the taxpayer or their employer. Tax codes are usually adjusted once a year to take into account any changes made in the National Budget, but can be altered more often to reflect an employee's circumstances. Tax codes can be changed if someone has paid too much or too little tax the previous tax year, if an employee receives state benefits, or has non-PAYE income (for example, self-employed earnings). Changes in a tax code are to ensure the employee has paid the correct amount of tax by the end of each tax year.",

Under less preservative conditions however, only a dark circular stain of organic material may be left in the fill of the posthole observable in plan and section. This differs in consistency from the less organic backfill of the posthole and can be identified simply through this change in make-up. The size and depth and of the postpipe can provide information as to any reuse of the posthole especially if several different postpipes can be identified.

            "Lophodermium\nLophodermium is a genus of fungi within the family Rhytismataceae. The genus contains 145 species and has a global distribution. Species of this genus are usually observed producing zone lines, conidiomata and ascomata on dead fallen leaves, but at least some are known to colonize living leaves. In many cases they then live inside the colonized leaf as a symptomless endobiont, where they are regarded as detritivores utilising dead plant matter. In a few cases they may kill all or part of the leaf prematurely, and there is a substantial literature dealing with those species as plant pathogens. The genus infects many different plant families but with a notable concentration in the family Pinaceae; many \"Lophodermium\" species are restricted to a single host genus (or even species), but some, particularly those infecting grasses, may infect several genera. Some are economically important plant pathogens, such as those that cause needlecast disease in European Black Pine, Scots Pine and Red Pine in forestry and christmas tree plantations. In these species, notably \"L. pinastri\" and \"L. seditiosum\", the fungal spores disperse and infect the pine needles in late summer, which turn brown by the following spring and then fall off.",

It provides Perkins' account of his career with engineering consulting firm Chas. T. Main in Boston. According to Perkins, his role at Main was to convince leaders of underdeveloped countries to accept substantial development loans for large construction and engineering projects that would primarily help the richest families and local elites, rather than the poor, while making sure that these projects were contracted to U.S. companies. Later these loans would give the U.S. political influence and access to natural resources for U.S. companies. He refers to this as an \"economic hit man.\" Although he states that throughout his career he has always worked for private companies, and suggests a system of corporatocracy and greed, rather than a single conspiracy, he claims the involvement of the National Security Agency (NSA), with whom he had interviewed for a job before joining Main. According to the author, this interview effectively constituted an independent screening which led to his subsequent hiring as an economic hit man by Einar Greve, a vice president of the firm (and alleged NSA liaison).",

            "Nicholas Scibetta was a Sicilian American mobster who was the nephew of Joseph and John Zicarelli, the brother-in-law of Sammy Gravano, and the uncle of mafioso Gerard Gravano. He was also known as \"Little Nicky\" and died in 1978. Additionally, there is no specific information available about his brother-in-law, Sammy Gravano, in the provided text.",
            "Nicholas Scibetta's brother-in-law is Sammy Gravano. Sammy Gravano confessed to being involved in various crimes, including 19 murders, drug trafficking, and racketeering as an underboss in the Gambino crime family. He later became a government witness and testified against his former boss, John Gotti.",
            "Sammy Gravano's confession to involvement in 19 murders had a significant impact on prosecutions, particularly in the case against John Gotti, the boss of the Gambino crime family. Gravano's confession and agreement to testify against Gotti and other mobsters led to the arrest of Gotti and other high-ranking members of the crime family on racketeering charges in December 1990. This confession and testimony provided crucial evidence for the prosecution and ultimately led to the downfall of Gotti and the Gambino crime family.\n\nGravano's confession and cooperation also had broader implications for organized crime prosecutions, as it demonstrated the effectiveness of leveraging insider testimony to bring down powerful criminal organizations. This case set a precedent for using insider testimony to dismantle criminal enterprises and has since been used in other high-profile organized crime cases.\n\nOverall, Sammy Gravano's confession and cooperation had a significant impact on prosecutions, particularly in the case against John Gotti and the Gambino crime family, and has influenced the approach to prosecuting organized crime cases.",
            "John Gotti, the boss of the Gambino crime family, was convicted with the help of testimony about these murders, particularly from Sammy Gravano's confession and cooperation."
