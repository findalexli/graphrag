Made by Edison Studios, the action serial consisted of twelve one-reel episodes released monthly beginning July 26, 1912 to coincide with the serial story of the same name published in McClure's \"The Ladies' World\" magazine. \"What Happened to Mary\" was performed as a stage play and published as a single-volume print novel, so is an early example of a multiple-media marketing campaign. The scripts were written by Horace G. Plympton and directed by Charles Brabin. The star of the serial was Mary Fuller."
