The aqueduct system was recognized by the American Society of Civil Engineers on the List of Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks in 1971.\n\nThe aqueduct system was designed by William Mulholland and was a key factor in the growth of Los Angeles into one of the largest cities in the world. The aqueduct led to disputes known as the California Water Wars. The aqueduct system was also connected to the St. Francis Dam, which failed in March 1928, leading to the end of Mulholland's career.\n\nThe aqueduct system also included the Dry Canyon Reservoir, which was a small reservoir formed by an embankment dam in the Sierra Pelona Mountains of northern Los Angeles County. The aqueduct project was politically masterminded by Frederick Eaton, and it was part of an extraordinary real estate development in Southern California.\n\nThe aqueduct system was completed in 1913, and it played a significant role in the development and expansion of the San Fernando Valley. The Pacific Electric streetcar service to Owensmouth (present-day Canoga Park) was part of this development. Owensmouth was founded in 1912 and joined the city of Los Angeles in 1917, eventually being renamed Canoga Park in 1931.\n\nIn conclusion, the Los Angeles Aqueduct system was completed in 1913 and has been in operation since then, providing water to the city of Los Angeles.",
