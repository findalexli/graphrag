            "Tartaglia (commedia dell'arte)\nTartaglia is a dainty character in the Commedia dell'arte. He is farsighted and with a minor stutter (hence his name; cf. Spanish tartamudear), he is usually classed as one of the group of old characters (vecchio) who appears in many scenarios as one of the lovers (innamorati). His social status varies; he is sometimes a bailiff, lawyer, notary or chemist. Dramatist Carlo Gozzi turned him into a statesman, and so he remained thereafter. Tartaglia wears a large felt hat, an enormous cloak, oversized boots, a long sword, a giant moustache and a cardboard nose. He usually represents the lower working class but at times the middle or upper class in the commedia dell'arte. In the opera \"Le maschere\" by Mascagni, one of the characters is Tartaglia, a stuttering servant.",

She was named for Fort Snelling at the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers, for many years the northernmost military post in the land of the Sioux and Chippewa. She was the second ship assigned that name, but the construction of \"Fort Snelling\"\u00a0(LSD-23) was canceled on 17 August 1945.",
            "Palerontobia\nPalerontobia is a monotypic genus of tiger moths in the \"Erebidae\" family. The genus includes only one species, Palerontobia kozlovi, which is found in north-eastern Tibet (China, Qinghai). The scientific name consists of two parts, \"Pale,\" is a part of the genus name \"Palearctia\", and \"rontobia,\" is a part of the genus name \"Orontobia\".

            "Fargo-class cruiser\nThe \"Fargo\"-class cruisers were a modified version of the previous \"Cleveland\"-class cruiser design; the main difference was a more compact pyramidal superstructure with single trunked funnel, intended to improve the arcs of fire of the anti-aircraft (AA) guns. The same type of modification differentiated the \"Baltimore\" and \"Oregon City\"\u00a0class es of heavy cruisers. Changes were made to order to reduce the instability of the Cleveland-class light cruisers, especially their tendency to roll dangerously. The main battery turrets sat about a foot lower and the wing gunhouses (the 5 inch, twin gun mounts on the sides of the ship) were lowered to the main deck. The medium (40\u00a0mm) anti-aircraft mounts were also lowered.",
            "Harrimanella\nHarrimanella is a genus of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae, with a single species, Harrimanella hypnoides, also known as moss bell heather. It was originally named Cassiope hypnoides by Linnaeus (1737) in his Flora Lapponica, but \"Harrimanella hypnoides\" is now the accepted name at ITIS. The species name \"hypnoides\" means 'like \"Hypnum\" ', which is a genus mosses.",
            "British Rail Class 87\nThe British Rail Class 87 is a type of electric locomotive built in 1973\u201375 by British Rail Engineering Limited. Thirty-six of these locomotives were built to work passenger services over the West Coast Main Line (WCML). They were the flagships of British Rail's electric locomotive fleet until the late 1980s, when the Class 90s started to come on stream. The privatisation of British Rail saw all but one of the fleet transferred to Virgin Trains. They continued their duties until the advent of the new Class 390 \"Pendolinos\", when they were transferred to other operators or withdrawn. There is only one Class 87 still in use in Britain, 87002, owned by the AC Locomotive Group and solely used alongside 86101 for the occasional charter train. A large proportion of the fleet have now been exported to Bulgaria. 87002 is currently hired by Serco to work the empty coaching stock of the \"Caledonian Sleeper\" services.",

Three species are currently recognized: the African bush elephant (\"Loxodonta africana\"), the African forest elephant (\"L. cyclotis\"), and the Asian elephant (\"Elephas maximus\").

            "Cantor\u2013Bernstein theorem\nIn set theory and order theory, the Cantor\u2013Bernstein theorem states that the cardinality of the second type class, the class of countable order types, equals the cardinality of the continuum. It was used by Felix Hausdorff and named by him after Georg Cantor and Felix Bernstein. Cantor constructed a family of countable order types with the cardinality of the continuum, and in his 1901 inaugural dissertation Bernstein proved that such a family can have no higher cardinality."
