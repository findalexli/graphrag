Their high-impact performance on this first time out recording led to their sponsorship by Hector \"El Father\". Through that relationship the duo recorded their first single, \"Cazando Voy,\" which reached platinum status and earned them the reputation as \"the MVP's of the year.\" In 2004, they signed with MVP Records and toured extensively throughout South and Central America. The success of their debut recording, Los MVP's, garnered the attention and an eventual distribution with Universal's Machete Music, a label targeting the ever-growing urban Latino audience. Appearances in many U.S. cities to receptive crowds has earned the duo a reputation as one of reggaeton's most popular duos. In 2005, their debut studio album \"Los MVP\" was released and featured the hit singles \"Ven Ba\u00edlalo\" and \"De Cazeria\". The album was certified Platinum by the United States Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and a special edition was released the following year. The special edition of \"Los MVP\" featured their two singles \"Fua\" and \"De Lao a Lao\". Performances at high-visibility events like opening Premios Juventud and closing the 2006 Latin Billboard Awards alongside Tito \"El Bambino\" and Wisin & Yandel continued to increase these budding artists' recognition and potential. Almost three years later, in 2008, their second studio album, Showtime was released. Singles featured on the album were \"La Vecina\" and \"Na De Na\". This album was released by Machete Music. Two years later, Da' Take Over, the duo's third studio album was released. It featured the hit singles \"Ayer La Vi\" & \"Me Enamor\u00e9\".",

            "Medieval archaeology\nMedieval archaeology is the study of humankind through its material culture, specialising in the period of the European Middle Ages. At its broadest, the period stretches from the 5th to the 16th century and refers to post-Roman but pre-modern remains. The period covers the upheaval caused by the fall of the Roman Empire and cultures such as the Vikings, Saxons, and Franks. Archaeologists often specialise in studying either the Early Middle Ages (Migration Period) or the High Middle Ages and Late Middle Ages, although many projects and professionals move across these chronological boundaries. The rich nature of the medieval written record has meant that archaeology has often been seen as the \"handmaiden to history\", especially in the later medieval period. Analysis of material culture may enrich or call into question written evidence from the medieval period and the two sources of evidence need to be used together. Medieval archaeology has examined the development of medieval settlements, particularly the development of medieval towns and castles. It has also contributed to understanding of the spread and development of Christian monasticism during the medieval period.",

Transactions of economic resources include capital, skills, people for the purpose of the international production of physical goods and services such as finance, banking, insurance, and construction. International business can also be referred to as globalization. Globalization is the shift toward a more integrated and interdependent economy. In order to conduct business overseas, multinational companies need to separate national markets into one huge global marketplace. Two macro factors underline the trend of greater globalization. The first is falling of barriers to make cross-border trade easier such as the free flow of goods and services, and capital, and the second factor is technological change, particularly the developments in communication, information processing, and transportation technologies."

The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can \"lighten\" a mood. (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.) Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors \"down to earth\" again. The song states a case strongly in favor of laughter, even if Mary Poppins appears to disapprove of Uncle Albert's behavior, especially since it not only complicates the task of getting Albert down, but the infectious mood sends Bert and the Banks children into the air as well.",
