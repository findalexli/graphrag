NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",

It saw the final phase of Rococo-style art as well as the birth of French neoclassicism and the Directoire style which followed it: whereas Rococo has become labeled as overdone and gawdy with its constant use of symmetric flourishes and excessive precise decoration, neoclassicism sought to evoke the artistic styles that were just then being rediscovered in Herculaneum and Pompeii: the straight column, the simplicity of the post-and-lintel, the architrave of the Greek temple, etc., as well as the Rousseau-inspired values of returning to nature and the view of nature as an idealized and wild but still orderly and inherently worthy model for the arts to follow.",

            "Louis XVI style\nLouis XVI style, frequently also called Louis Seize, is a characteristic French style in art, architecture, and decorative motif which developed during the 19-year reign of the French monarch Louis XVI (1774\u20131793) though it often thought to encompass nearly twice that many (1750-1800). It saw the final phase of Rococo-style art as well as the birth of French neoclassicism and the Directoire style which followed it: whereas Rococo has become labeled as overdone and gawdy with its constant use of symmetric flourishes and excessive precise decoration, neoclassicism sought to evoke the artistic styles that were just then being rediscovered in Herculaneum and Pompeii: the straight column, the simplicity of the post-and-lintel, the architrave of the Greek temple, etc., as well as the Rousseau-inspired values of returning to nature and the view of nature as an idealized and wild but still orderly and inherently worthy model for the arts to follow.",

It was renamed as St Luke's hospital in September 2004 to signify the hospital's role as a community hospital while retaining its focus on geriatric care. The idea of setting up community hospital was first mooted by a group of Christian doctors and nurses after a report from the Advisory Council on the Aged in 1988 raised important issues concerning the lack of adequate elderly care facilities in Singapore. A projection of the number of facilities and resources needed to provide adequate healthcare services to Singapore's ageing population in 2030 revealed serious shortfalls. In response to the problem of inadequate healthcare facilities for the elderly, a group of 8 churches and Christian organisations including the Graduate Christian Fellowship and the Singapore Nurses' Christian Fellowship came together to set up St Luke's Hospital for the Elderly Sick.

A projection of the number of facilities and resources needed to provide adequate healthcare services to Singapore's ageing population in 2030 revealed serious shortfalls. In response to the problem of inadequate healthcare facilities for the elderly, a group of 8 churches and Christian organisations including the Graduate Christian Fellowship and the Singapore Nurses' Christian Fellowship came together to set up St Luke's Hospital for the Elderly Sick.

There was also a general store located in the commercial space on the main floor. Because medical care in a hospital was new in the community, it did not succeed and it folded in 1905. Whitmore left to become a missionary in China. The building housed professional offices and retail businesses until 1914 when the Nurses' Benevolent Association under the auspices of the Seventh-day Adventist Church bought the building for a hospital. It was more successful as a hospital the second time, and it was acquired by the city for a community hospital in 1920. After a new hospital building was constructed in 1951, the Good Samaritan Society bought the building for a nursing home. By 1973 changes in state law no longer made operating a nursing home here feasible.

            "St Luke's Hospital, Singapore\nSt Luke's Hospital is a community hospital in Singapore that provides professional healthcare services. It was named after the patron saint of the medical profession, St Luke. St Luke's Hospital for the Elderly Sick was registered as a voluntary welfare organisation in the Registry of Societies in October 1991. It was renamed as St Luke's hospital in September 2004 to signify the hospital's role as a community hospital while retaining its focus on geriatric care. The idea of setting up community hospital was first mooted by a group of Christian doctors and nurses after a report from the Advisory Council on the Aged in 1988 raised important issues concerning the lack of adequate elderly care facilities in Singapore. A projection of the number of facilities and resources needed to provide adequate healthcare services to Singapore's ageing population in 2030 revealed serious shortfalls. In response to the problem of inadequate healthcare facilities for the elderly, a group of 8 churches and Christian organisations including the Graduate Christian Fellowship and the Singapore Nurses' Christian Fellowship came together to set up St Luke's Hospital for the Elderly Sick. St Luke's Hospital is headed by a board of directors and various committees that oversee the daily operations of the hospital.",

            "Louis XVI style\nLouis XVI style, frequently also called Louis Seize, is a characteristic French style in art, architecture, and decorative motif which developed during the 19-year reign of the French monarch Louis XVI (1774\u20131793) though it often thought to encompass nearly twice that many (1750-1800). It saw the final phase of Rococo-style art as well as the birth of French neoclassicism and the Directoire style which followed it: whereas Rococo has become labeled as overdone and gawdy with its constant use of symmetric flourishes and excessive precise decoration, neoclassicism sought to evoke the artistic styles that were just then being rediscovered in Herculaneum and Pompeii: the straight column, the simplicity of the post-and-lintel, the architrave of the Greek temple, etc., as well as the Rousseau-inspired values of returning to nature and the view of nature as an idealized and wild but still orderly and inherently worthy model for the arts to follow.",
