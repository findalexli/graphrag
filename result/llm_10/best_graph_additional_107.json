Given that Patek Philippe & Co. was founded in 1851, it is likely that Gostkowski was a lawyer for the company during the mid-19th century. His involvement with the company may have included legal counsel, contract negotiations, and other legal matters related to the operation of the business. It is also possible that he played a role in the company's expansion and development of new timepieces, such as the Patek Philippe Calibre 89 and the Calatrava line of watches. His legal expertise may have been instrumental in protecting the company's intellectual property and ensuring compliance with industry regulations.",
