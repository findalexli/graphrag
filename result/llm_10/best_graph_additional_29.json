It saw the final phase of Rococo-style art as well as the birth of French neoclassicism and the Directoire style which followed it: whereas Rococo has become labeled as overdone and gawdy with its constant use of symmetric flourishes and excessive precise decoration, neoclassicism sought to evoke the artistic styles that were just then being rediscovered in Herculaneum and Pompeii: the straight column, the simplicity of the post-and-lintel, the architrave of the Greek temple, etc., as well as the Rousseau-inspired values of returning to nature and the view of nature as an idealized and wild but still orderly and inherently worthy model for the arts to follow.",
