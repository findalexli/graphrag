The specific name honours the palaeontologist Rinchen Barsbold.

The lifeboat was missing, yet the \"Mary Celeste\" herself was still under sail and there were signs of a sudden and unexplained abandonment.

Morehouse and his crew took the derelict \"Mary Celeste\" to Gibraltar and claimed the brigantine as salvage. They were at first subjected to suspicion by Gilbraltar's Attorney General but the Vice Admiralty Court later approved their salvage and commended the crew of \"Dei Gratia\" for their resourcefulness and courage. The salvage award for recovering the mysterious brigantine of about $8,300 was diminished by the high court costs of the long inquiry. \"Dei Gratia\" was sold to Irish owners in 1881. She was wrecked at Black Rock, Dale, Pembrokeshire after breaking her moorings in a southeast storm on 27th Dec 1907.

Pearson said of her decision to write her book, \"I just want to let people know where I came from ... to share my story. I know the Lord has blessed me. He gave me the power just to tell this story.\" The book also depicts the difficulty with which Pearson attempts to adjust to life after prison; she is fired from two jobs due to her criminal background, which drives her to return temporarily to drug dealing.

That's sad to say, but what (was) I supposed to be, starving? Go to a shelter?\"",
