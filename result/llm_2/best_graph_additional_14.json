Bruce Dickinson replaced Di'Anno after the release of \"Killers\", although he did not contribute any songwriting to \"The Number of the Beast\", released in 1982, which featured three songs co-written by guitarist Adrian Smith. \"The Number of the Beast\" also spawned Iron Maiden's first UK Singles Chart top ten in the form of \"Run to the Hills\", which charted at number seven on its release. It was not until 1983's \"Piece of Mind\" that the songwriting process became a more varied and collaborative approach, with just four of its nine tracks being credited solely to Harris, two to Dickinson and Smith, one to Harris and Murray, one to Dickinson alone, and one to Harris, Dickinson, and Smith. The Dickinson and Smith-penned \"Flight of Icarus\" was the first Iron Maiden single to chart in the United States, reaching number eight on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock chart."

Other variations include the \"barrel roll\" where the roll is completed inside the barrel, and the \"rollo takeoff\" which is performed while catching the wave. This trick was named by someone in the industry. I remember the story where Pat Caldwell did the roll and Jack Lindholm or whoever saw him do it and commented \"what do you call that an el rollo\".

The ride opened in 2013, replacing The Rattler, a wooden roller coaster, by putting a new steel track on top of The Rattler's wooden support structure. The distance between the lowest and highest points of the first drop was increased from 124 to and the drop was made steeper by changing the angle to 81 degrees. The resulting modifications increased the speed of the trains from 65 to .

            "El Rollo\nAn El Rollo (Spanish for \"The Roll\") is a bodyboarding trick performed when the bodyboarder hits the lip of the wave and uses its power to throw himself out with the lip in a perfect arc to complete a roll before landing on the wave surface or into the white water. When the bodyboarder detaches completely from the wave surface or the lip the trick is called an \"air roll\" or \"aerial roll\". Other variations include the \"barrel roll\" where the roll is completed inside the barrel, and the \"rollo takeoff\" which is performed while catching the wave. This trick was named by someone in the industry. I remember the story where Pat Caldwell did the roll and Jack Lindholm or whoever saw him do it and commented \"what do you call that an el rollo\". Photos of the new move and captions started appearing in Bodyboarding Magazine. The move and the term caught on and spread around the world.",
            "Negative inversion\nIn linguistics, negative inversion is one of many types of subject-auxiliary inversion in English. A negation (e.g. \"not\", \"no\", \"never\", \"nothing\", etc.) or a word that implies negation (\"only\", \"hardly\", \"scarcely\") or a phrase containing one of these words precedes the finite auxiliary verb necessitating that the subject and finite verb undergo inversion. Negative inversion is a phenomenon of English syntax. The V2 word order of other Germanic languages does not allow one to acknowledge negative inversion as a specific phenomenon, since their V2 principle, which is mostly absent from English, allows inversion to occur much more often than in English. While negative inversion is a common occurrence in English, a solid understanding of just what elicits the inversion has not yet been established. It is, namely, not entirely clear why certain fronted expressions containing a negation elicit negative inversion, but others do not.",

It was Harrison's second composition in the Indian classical style, after \"Love You To\", and was inspired by his six-week stay in India with his mentor and sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar, over September\u2013October 1966. Recorded in London without the other Beatles, the song features Indian instrumentation such as sitar, dilruba and tabla, and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle. The recording marked a significant departure from the Beatles' previous work; musically, it evokes the Indian devotional tradition, while the overtly spiritual quality of the lyrics reflects Harrison's absorption in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas. Although the song was his only composition on \"Sgt.

            "List of songs recorded by Iron Maiden\nIron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed by bassist Steve Harris in 1975. The band's first album, 1980's \"Iron Maiden\", was written primarily by Harris, with vocalist Paul Di'Anno co-writing two tracks and guitarist Dave Murray contributing \"Charlotte the Harlot\". The 1981 follow-up, \"Killers\", was written almost entirely by the bassist, with frontman Di'Anno contributing only to the title track, \"Killers\" (the North American bonus track \"Twilight Zone\" was credited to Harris and Murray). Bruce Dickinson replaced Di'Anno after the release of \"Killers\", although he did not contribute any songwriting to \"The Number of the Beast\", released in 1982, which featured three songs co-written by guitarist Adrian Smith. \"The Number of the Beast\" also spawned Iron Maiden's first UK Singles Chart top ten in the form of \"Run to the Hills\", which charted at number seven on its release. It was not until 1983's \"Piece of Mind\" that the songwriting process became a more varied and collaborative approach, with just four of its nine tracks being credited solely to Harris, two to Dickinson and Smith, one to Harris and Murray, one to Dickinson alone, and one to Harris, Dickinson, and Smith. The Dickinson and Smith-penned \"Flight of Icarus\" was the first Iron Maiden single to chart in the United States, reaching number eight on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock chart."
