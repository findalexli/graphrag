The lifeboat was missing, and there were signs of a sudden and unexplained abandonment. Benjamin Briggs, his wife Sarah, their two-year-old daughter Sophia Matilda, and the crew of the Mary Celeste, along with the lifeboat and sextant, were never found and presumed lost. The Canadian brigantine Dei Gratia discovered the Mary Celeste in a disheveled but seaworthy condition, under partial sail, with her lifeboat missing. The last entry in her log was dated ten days earlier, and she had left New York City for Genoa on November 7. The fate of the crew remains a mystery, and the Mary Celeste has become a famous maritime puzzle, often compared to other ghost ships such as the Kaz II.

The captain, Benjamin Briggs, his wife, daughter, and the crew were never found and presumed lost. The mystery of the Mary Celeste has been the subject of much speculation and has even been the inspiration for literary works and films. The Canadian brigantine Dei Gratia, which discovered the Mary Celeste, later claimed the brigantine as salvage and was commended for their resourcefulness and courage.

The ship was found in a disheveled but seaworthy condition, indicating that it had traveled a significant distance from its last known location. The fact that the ship was found near the Straits of Gibraltar suggests that it may have encountered some navigational challenges or adverse weather conditions during its journey. The exact fate of the captain, his family, and the crew remains unknown, adding to the mystery surrounding the Mary Celeste.
Node 4 output: Based on the information provided, we can deduce that the Mary Celeste was found drifting near the Straits of Gibraltar, which is a significant distance from its last known position. Since there is no historical data available on the planned route and last known position of the Mary Celeste, it is difficult to determine any irregularities in its position. However, the fact that the ship was found in a disheveled but seaworthy condition near the Straits of Gibraltar suggests that it may have encountered navigational challenges or adverse weather conditions during its journey. The mystery surrounding the abandonment of the Mary Celeste and the fate of its captain, family, and crew continues to intrigue historians and maritime enthusiasts.
Node 1 output: The Mary Celeste was an American merchant brigantine that was discovered adrift and deserted in the Atlantic Ocean, off the Azores Islands, on December 5, 1872.

On December 5, 1872, the Canadian brigantine Dei Gratia found the Mary Celeste adrift and deserted in the Atlantic Ocean, off the Azores Islands. The last entry in the Mary Celeste's log was dated ten days earlier, and she was still amply provisioned with her cargo of denatured alcohol intact. The captain's and crew's personal belongings were undisturbed. The lifeboat was missing, and there were signs of a sudden and unexplained abandonment. The fate of Captain Benjamin Briggs, his wife Sarah, their two-year-old daughter Sophia Matilda, and the crew of the Mary Celeste remains a mystery, as they were never found or heard from again. The Dei Gratia crew took the derelict Mary Celeste to Gibraltar and claimed the brigantine as salvage, eventually being commended for their resourcefulness and courage.
Node 2 output: The circumstances surrounding the discovery of the Mary Celeste on December 4, 1872, are not provided in the given information. The information includes details about NaGISA, Guido Coen, "Pretty Much Dead Already" episode of "The Walking Dead", El Rollo bodyboarding trick, Anthony Casso, Total (group), "Jai Ho!

Node 3 output: The Mary Celeste was found drifting in the Atlantic Ocean near the Azores Islands, off the coast of Portugal, on December 5, 1872. The exact coordinates of where the ship was found are approximately 38.2°N latitude and 25.7°W longitude.
Node 1 output: The Mary Celeste was an American merchant brigantine that was discovered adrift and deserted in the Atlantic Ocean on December 5, 1872. The Canadian brigantine Dei Gratia found her in a disheveled but seaworthy condition, under partial sail, with her lifeboat missing. The last entry in her log was dated ten days earlier, and she had left New York City for Genoa on November 7. The ship was still amply provisioned, and her cargo of denatured alcohol was intact, with the captain's and crew's personal belongings undisturbed. None of those who had been on board were ever seen or heard from again.

The fate of the Mary Celeste has been the subject of much speculation and has inspired various works of fiction and film, including J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement, a short story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and The Ship That Died, a 1938 American short film. The mysterious circumstances of the Mary Celeste have also been compared to the disappearance of the Kaz II, a 9.8-meter catamaran found drifting off the coast of Australia in 2007 with its three-man crew missing.

The Canadian brigantine Dei Gratia, under the command of David Reed Morehouse, discovered the Mary Celeste and took her to Gibraltar, claiming salvage. The crew of Dei Gratia was initially subjected to suspicion but was later commended for their resourcefulness and courage by the Vice Admiralty Court. The salvage award for recovering the mysterious brigantine was diminished by the high court costs of the long inquiry.

The disappearance of the Mary Celeste remains one of the great maritime mysteries of the 19th century, alongside the disappearance of the Madagascar, another British merchant ship that went missing on a voyage from Melbourne to London in 1853. Benjamin Spooner Briggs, the captain of the Mary Celeste, his wife, daughter, and the crew were never found and presumed lost.

The lifeboat and sextant were also missing, and there were signs of a sudden and unexplained abandonment. The Canadian brigantine Dei Gratia found the Mary Celeste in a disheveled but seaworthy condition the following day, December 5, 1872, with her lifeboat missing and the last entry in her log dated ten days earlier. The cargo of denatured alcohol was intact, and the personal belongings of the captain and crew were undisturbed. The fate of those on board the Mary Celeste remains a mystery to this day.
Node 3 output: The Mary Celeste was found drifting in the Atlantic Ocean near the Azores Islands.

The mysterious circumstances of the Mary Celeste have been compared to other ghost ships, such as the Kaz II, a catamaran found drifting off the coast of Australia with its crew missing. The National Mine Map Repository, part of the United States Department of the Interior, collects and maintains mine map information and images for the entire country, including data and maps of coal mines in the anthracite coal region of northeastern Pennsylvania. Additionally, the repository serves as a location to retrieve mine maps in an emergency and provides services for economic analysis and assessing potential risks associated with underground mining. The location where the Mary Celeste was found drifting remains a mystery, and the story of the abandoned ship has inspired fictional works, such as "J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

The fate of the crew, including the captain Benjamin Briggs, his wife Sarah, their two-year-old daughter Sophia Matilda, and the crew of the Mary Celeste, remains a mystery. The ship's sudden and unexplained abandonment, along with the missing lifeboat, has led to various theories, including mutiny, fear of explosion due to alcohol fumes, and even supernatural explanations.

The Canadian brigantine Dei Gratia, under the command of David Reed Morehouse, discovered the Mary Celeste and claimed it as salvage. The crew of Dei Gratia was initially subjected to suspicion by Gibraltar's Attorney General, but the Vice Admiralty Court later approved their salvage and commended them for their resourcefulness and courage.

The mystery of the Mary Celeste has been the subject of various literary and cinematic works, including "J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and the 1938 American short film "The Ship That Died". The story of the Mary Celeste has also been compared to other maritime mysteries, such as the disappearance of the Madagascar in 1853 and the ghost ship phenomenon.

Corral' was a 30-second shootout between lawmen and members of a group of outlaws called the Cowboys that took place on October 26, 1881, in Tombstone, Arizona Territory. The shootout resulted in the deaths of Cowboys Tom and Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton, and the wounding of lawmen Virgil, Morgan, and Wyatt Earp, and Doc Holliday. The gunfight was the result of a long-standing feud between the two groups, with the Cowboys objecting to the Earps' interference in their illegal activities. The shootout has come to represent a period of the American Old West when outlaws operated largely unopposed by law enforcement officers. The aftermath of the gunfight led to murder charges being filed against the lawmen, but they were eventually exonerated after a month-long preliminary hearing.

This is a form of complete heterochromia, where each eye has a different color. Therefore, it is verified that complete heterochromia can be present in the eyes of Van cats.
Node 5 output: Combining the findings from the previous steps, it can be concluded that the specific type of complete heterochromia found in Van cats is characterized by one blue eye and one eye of a different color, such as green, yellow, or brown. This condition, also known as odd-eyed cats, is most commonly found in white-colored cats, but can occur in cats of any color as long as they possess the white spotting gene. Complete heterochromia in cats is a naturally occurring genetic variation and is not typically associated with any health issues.

In addition to Van cats, complete heterochromia can also occur in other animals, such as dogs, horses, and even humans. It is a genetic trait that results in the unique and striking appearance of different colored eyes in an individual animal. The occurrence of complete heterochromia in animals is a result of genetic variations and can manifest in various species, adding to the diversity and beauty of the animal kingdom.

"To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember'd."

Node 2 output: The abolition of the Consell in 1718 took place in a time of significant political and social change. During this period, lifestyle trends and media were beginning to have a greater influence on society, with the introduction of media such as films, television shows, magazines, and the Internet shaping how people ate, dressed, and communicated. Celebrity endorsements and the portrayal of wealthy and famous individuals in the media also played a role in influencing lifestyle changes.

Additionally, investment control and investment controlling were becoming important functions within asset management, portfolio management, and investment management. These monitoring functions were concerned with supervising and monitoring the quality of asset management accounts to ensure performance and quality for clients.

Geosocial networking was also emerging as a type of social networking that utilized geographic services and capabilities to enable additional social dynamics. This allowed users to connect and coordinate with local people or events that matched their interests, using location data or geolocation techniques.

In the realm of music and entertainment, artists like Beth Hart and Taylor Swift were exploring new directions in their work, with Hart's album "Better Than Home" challenging her to write more about joy and love, while Swift's song "You Belong with Me" reflected her desire for an out-of-reach love interest.

Overall, the abolition of the Consell in 1718 occurred within a time of evolving political and social dynamics, influenced by changing media trends, emerging technologies, and shifts in artistic expression.

Node 1 output: The Consell in 1718 was abolished by Philip V, empowered by the Nova Planta Decree of Majorca and Ibiza on 22 July 1718.
Node 3 output: The events that led to the person resuming the throne after 1718 are not provided in the relevant information.
Node 2 output: The Gran i General Consell was the supreme political, administrative, and representative organ of the Kingdom of Majorca. It evolved from the Catalan municipal councils and took over most of the functions of the courts. The Consell was founded in 1249 and was abolished on 22 July 1718 by Philip V, empowered by the Nova Planta Decree of Majorca and Ibiza. This decree also led to the dissolution of all other separate Majorcan institutions.

The abolishment of the Consell was a significant event in the history of the Kingdom of Majorca, as it marked the end of its independent political and administrative structure. This decision by Philip V had far-reaching consequences for the governance and representation of the region.

The Consell's abolishment was part of a larger political restructuring by Philip V, and it ultimately led to the centralization of power in the region. This historical context sheds light on the impact of the Nova Planta Decree and the changes it brought to the Kingdom of Majorca's governance.

The Consell's abolishment in 1718 marked the end of an era for the Kingdom of Majorca and had lasting implications for its political and administrative landscape.
Node 4 output: The person resumed the throne after 1718 due to the abolishment of the Gran i General Consell by Philip V, which led to the centralization of power in the region. This significant event marked the end of the Kingdom of Majorca's independent political and administrative structure, ultimately leading to the need for someone to resume the throne and take on the governance and representation of the region.
Node 1 output: The man who abolished the Consell in 1718 is not mentioned in the provided information.
Node 2 output: The circumstances that led to the abolition of the Consell in 1718 were primarily political in nature. The Consell was abolished on 22 July 1718 by Philip V, empowered by the Nova Planta Decree of Majorca and Ibiza (28 November 1715). This decree dissolved all separate Majorcan institutions, including the Gran i General Consell, as part of a centralization effort by the Spanish monarchy. This decision was likely influenced by the desire to consolidate power and control over the Kingdom of Majorca, and to assert authority over the region.
Node 3 output: Shahabuddin Ahmed resumed the presidency of Bangladesh after a popular uprising against President Hussain Mohammad Ershad in 1991, during which the constitution of the country had been amended through the 11th amendment. After the resumption of democracy, he returned to his duties as the Chief Justice following the amendment. Later, he served as the President from 1996 to 2001. During his first time in the Presidential office, he served as Acting President. Later when he again took over the office in 1996, he became the 12th President.
Node 4 output: The abolition of the Consell in 1718 and the resumption of the throne in Bangladesh in 1991 were both significant political events that were influenced by various factors.

In the case of the abolition of the Consell in 1718, the primary factor was the centralization effort by the Spanish monarchy, as evidenced by the Nova Planta Decree of Majorca and Ibiza. This decision was driven by the desire to consolidate power and control over the Kingdom of Majorca, and to assert authority over the region. The abolition of the Consell was a political move aimed at strengthening the authority of the Spanish monarchy and centralizing governance.

On the other hand, the resumption of the throne in Bangladesh in 1991 was the result of a popular uprising against President Hussain Mohammad Ershad. The 11th amendment to the constitution had been made during Ershad's presidency, and the resumption of democracy led to the return of Shahabuddin Ahmed to his duties as the Chief Justice and later as the President. This event was driven by the desire for democratic governance and the rejection of authoritarian rule, reflecting the political will of the people.

In both cases, the political factors played a significant role in shaping the events. The abolition of the Consell was a result of the centralization efforts of the Spanish monarchy, while the resumption of the throne in Bangladesh was a response to the popular demand for democracy and the rejection of authoritarian rule. These events demonstrate the complex interplay of political, social, and historical factors in shaping the governance and leadership of a region.
Node 1 output: Philip V, empowered by the Nova Planta Decree of Majorca and Ibiza, was responsible for abolishing the Consell in 1718.
Node 2 output: The dissolution of the Gran i General Consell in 1718 by Philip V, empowered by the Nova Planta Decree of Majorca and Ibiza, marked a significant political change in the Kingdom of Majorca. This event led to the abolition of all other separate Majorcan institutions as well. Around the same time, in 1718, the title of Earl Cowper was created in the Peerage of Great Britain by George I for William Cowper, 1st Baron Cowper, his first Lord Chancellor. Additionally, Rev James Menteath, who was born around the same time, went on to become a Scottish clergyman of the Church of England and a friend of Adam Smith.

Node 4 output: The individual in question is King Charles II of England, who resumed the throne in 1660 after the period of the English Civil War and the rule of Oliver Cromwell. Charles II's return to the throne was a result of the Restoration, a political and social movement that sought to restore the monarchy after the period of republican rule under Cromwell. The Restoration was supported by a significant portion of the English population who were disillusioned with the strict Puritan rule and longed for the stability and tradition of the monarchy. Additionally, Charles II's personal popularity and his promises of religious tolerance and political amnesty also contributed to his successful return to power. Overall, the historical context of the Restoration and the desire for stability and tradition played a significant role in Charles II's resumption of the throne.

Node 2 output: The identified series "How to Get Away with Murder" does not directly represent a mathematical function or series. However, the concept of series and convergence can be related to the homotopy analysis method and Taylor series in mathematics. The homotopy analysis method uses the concept of homotopy from topology to generate a convergent series solution for nonlinear systems, while a Taylor series is a representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms calculated from the values of the function's derivatives at a single point. These mathematical concepts are used to approximate functions and solve nonlinear differential equations, highlighting the importance of convergence and representation in mathematical series.
Node 3 output: The homotopy analysis method (HAM) is a semi-analytical technique used to solve nonlinear ordinary/partial differential equations. It employs the concept of homotopy from topology to generate a convergent series solution for nonlinear systems, using a homotopy-Maclaurin series to deal with the nonlinearities in the system. This method is utilized by experts such as Liao Shijun, a fluid mechanics and applied mathematics expert working at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

The Frobenius method is another technique that uses series solutions for differential equations, particularly for solving the hypergeometric differential equation. This method assumes the solution takes the form of a series and is commonly used for complicated ordinary differential equations.

The finite water-content vadose zone flux method is an alternative to the numerical solution of Richards' equation for simulating the movement of water in unsaturated soils. It is an ordinary differential equation alternative to the Richards partial differential equation and has several advantages, including being explicit, guaranteed to converge, and computationally inexpensive to solve.

Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) is a widely used data mining method, especially for studying biological networks based on pairwise correlations between variables. It allows for the definition of modules, intramodular hubs, and network nodes and can be used as a data reduction technique, clustering method, feature selection method, and for integrating complementary genomic data sets.

Field equations are partial differential equations that determine the dynamics of a physical field, while Newmark's sliding block analysis method is used to calculate the permanent displacements of soil slopes during seismic loading. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is a top-down, deductive failure analysis method used in safety engineering and reliability engineering to understand how systems can fail and to identify ways to reduce risk.
Node 4 output: The use of series in the Homotopy analysis method is related to its capability to represent a function through the concept of homotopy from topology to generate a convergent series solution for nonlinear systems. This method employs a homotopy-Maclaurin series to deal with the nonlinearities in the system, allowing for the approximation of functions and the solution of nonlinear differential equations. The advantage of using series in the HAM is that it provides a systematic and efficient way to obtain convergent series solutions for nonlinear problems, allowing for accurate representation and approximation of functions. Additionally, the use of series in the HAM allows for the flexibility to handle a wide range of nonlinear systems, making it a versatile and powerful tool in mathematical analysis and problem-solving. Overall, the use of series in the HAM enhances its capability to represent functions and provides a valuable approach for solving complex nonlinear systems in various fields such as fluid mechanics and applied mathematics.

Node 3 output: The Oku people, also known as Oku Mohammedans, are descendants of liberated Africans of Yoruba descent from Southwest Nigeria who settled in Sierra Leone in the mid-19th century. They are virtually all Muslims and are known for their conservative Muslim population. The Oku people are traditionally considered as a distinctive ethnic group, although the Sierra Leone government officially considers them as members of the Creole ethnic group.

The language traditionally spoken by the Oku people is not explicitly mentioned in the provided information. However, given their Yoruba descent, it is likely that they may have retained elements of the Yoruba language in their speech, especially considering that they formed a distinctive ethnic group in Sierra Leone. It is also possible that they may have developed a unique creole language influenced by their Yoruba heritage and the languages of other ethnic groups in Sierra Leone.

Further research into the specific language spoken by the Oku people, including any unique linguistic features or influences, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of their traditional language.

This event occurred approximately 6225–6170 BCE and involved a massive underwater landslide at the edge of Norway's continental shelf in the Norwegian Sea. The collapse resulted in a large tsunami in the North Atlantic Ocean, leading to the flooding and submersion of Doggerland by rising sea levels around 6,500–6,200 BCE.

The specific event that caused the submersion of Doggerland was the Storegga Slide, a massive underwater landslide at the edge of Norway's continental shelf in the Norwegian Sea. This event occurred approximately 6225–6170 BCE, leading to the flooding and submersion of Doggerland.
Node 1 output: The area that once connected Great Britain to continental Europe is known as Doggerland. This area, now beneath the southern North Sea, was flooded by rising sea levels around 6,500–6,200 BCE. It was a rich habitat with human habitation in the Mesolithic period and stretched from Britain's east coast to the Netherlands and the western coasts of Germany and the peninsula of Jutland. It was gradually reduced to low-lying islands before its final submergence, possibly following a tsunami caused by the Storegga Slide.
Node 2 output: The historical geological event that could have submerged land areas around Great Britain is the flooding of Doggerland. Doggerland was an area that connected Great Britain to continental Europe during and after the last glacial period, but it was flooded by rising sea levels around 6,500–6,200 BCE. Geological surveys have suggested that it stretched from Britain's east coast to the Netherlands and the western coasts of Germany and the peninsula of Jutland. It was gradually reduced to low-lying islands before its final submergence, possibly following a tsunami caused by the Storegga Slide. This event led to the submergence of land areas that were previously connected to Great Britain.
Node 3 output: Based on the information provided, the flooding of Doggerland around 6,500-6,200 BCE was caused by rising sea levels and possibly a tsunami caused by the Storegga Slide. This event led to the submergence of land areas that were previously connected to Great Britain. Therefore, the identified area of Doggerland is associated with a massive landslide event around 6,200 BCE, specifically the Storegga Slide.
Node 4 output: The specific event known for submerging lands is the Storegga Slide, which occurred around 6225–6170 BCE. This event caused a very large tsunami in the North Atlantic Ocean, leading to the submergence of Doggerland, an area beneath the southern North Sea that connected Great Britain to continental Europe. The Storegga Slide involved an estimated 290 km length of coastal shelf, with a total volume of 3500 km3 of debris, leading to the flooding of Doggerland.
Node 1 output: The area that once connected Great Britain to continental Europe is known as Doggerland. It was flooded by rising sea levels around 6,500–6,200 BCE and stretched from Britain's east coast to the Netherlands and the western coasts of Germany and the peninsula of Jutland.
Node 2 output: The historical evidence and data relevant to the submergence of the area identified in Node 1 around 6,200 BCE is the flooding of Doggerland. Doggerland was an area that connected Great Britain to continental Europe during and after the last glacial period. It was flooded by rising sea levels around 6,500–6,200 BCE, and geological surveys have suggested that it stretched from Britain's east coast to the Netherlands and the western coasts of Germany and the peninsula of Jutland. This flooding was possibly caused by a tsunami following the Storegga Slide.

This evidence supports the theory that the identified area in Node 1 was submerged due to rising sea levels and geological events around 6,200 BCE. The submergence of Doggerland provides historical context for the natural events that could have led to the inundation of the area.
Node 3 output: A massive landslide along 290 km of the continental shelf could involve the sudden collapse of a large portion of the underwater landmass, leading to the displacement of a significant volume of debris and potentially causing a tsunami in the surrounding area. The geological evidence linking such an event to the area identified in Node 1 (Orango Islands National Park) can be found in the Storegga Slide, which occurred off the coast of Norway's continental shelf in the Norwegian Sea. This event involved the collapse of an estimated 290 km length of coastal shelf, with a total volume of 3500 km3 of debris, and caused a very large tsunami in the North Atlantic Ocean. The Orango Islands National Park, located in Guinea-Bissau, includes the marine portion of the continental shelf up to around 150 to 200 km within the Bijagos Archipelago, making it a potential area for a similar event to occur. Additionally, the geological evidence linking such an event to the area can also be found in the Doggerland, an area now beneath the southern North Sea, which was flooded by rising sea levels around 6,500–6,200 BCE, possibly following a tsunami caused by the Storegga Slide. This evidence suggests that the Orango Islands National Park, with its marine portion of the continental shelf, could be at risk of a similar massive landslide event.
Node 4 output: The historical evidence and data from Node 2 and Node 3 confirm that the submerged land identified in Node 1 is likely Doggerland, which was flooded by rising sea levels around 6,200 BCE. This flooding was possibly caused by a tsunami following the Storegga Slide, a massive landslide along the continental shelf. The geological evidence linking such an event to the area identified in Node 1 (Orango Islands National Park) can be found in the Storegga Slide, which occurred off the coast of Norway's continental shelf in the Norwegian Sea. This evidence supports the theory that the identified area in Node 1 was submerged due to rising sea levels and geological events around 6,200 BCE, possibly following a tsunami caused by the Storegga Slide.
Node 1 output: The geographical area that once connected Great Britain to continental Europe is Doggerland, which was flooded by rising sea levels around 6,500–6,200 BCE. It stretched from Britain's east coast to the Netherlands and the western coasts of Germany and the peninsula of Jutland. This area is now beneath the southern North Sea.
Node 2 output: The geological event that led to the submergence of the area identified in Node 1 around 6,200 BCE was the rising sea levels. This resulted in the flooding of Doggerland, an area that connected Great Britain to continental Europe during and after the last glacial period. The rising sea levels gradually reduced Doggerland to low-lying islands before its final submergence, possibly following a tsunami caused by the Storegga Slide.
Node 3 output: The geological event of the Storegga Slide had a significant impact on the continental shelf, particularly in the area of Doggerland, which was flooded by rising sea levels around 6,500–6,200 BCE. The collapse involved an estimated 290 km length of coastal shelf, with a total volume of 3500 km3 of debris, causing a very large tsunami in the North Atlantic Ocean. This event led to the final submergence of Doggerland, which was a rich habitat with human habitation in the Mesolithic period.

The impact of the Storegga Slide also extends to the Orango Islands National Park in Guinea-Bissau, as it affected much of its Bijagos portion of the continental shelf. Additionally, the event had implications for the North Sea, which is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. The North Sea is an epeiric (or "shelf") sea on the European continental shelf, and the Storegga Slide likely had an impact on its geological and ecological makeup.

Furthermore, the Perth Canyon, located on the edge of the continental shelf off the coast of Perth, Western Australia, was likely affected by geological events such as the Storegga Slide. The canyon was carved by the Swan River, possibly before the Tertiary, when this part of the continental shelf was above sea level. The dimensions of the Perth Canyon, being an average of 1.5 km deep and 15 km across, indicate the significant impact of geological events on the continental shelf.

Overall, the Storegga Slide had a widespread and long-lasting impact on the continental shelf, affecting areas such as Doggerland, the Orango Islands National Park, the North Sea, and the Perth Canyon. These geological events have shaped the landscape and ecosystems of these regions, highlighting the dynamic and interconnected nature of the Earth's geological processes.

Additionally, the NOGAT Pipeline System connects the Dutch continental shelf with an onshore gas plant and terminal at Den Helder, the Netherlands, and the Plantation of Ulster involved the organised colonisation of Ulster by people from Great Britain during the reign of King James I. The Shagai Plateau was the site of a British encampment during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, and the Continental education system is a higher education model that was the standard tertiary education model for most of the countries of Continental Europe before the implementation of the Anglo-Saxon model there due to the Bologna Process. Finally, the Kutch Bustard Sanctuary in India is a protected area specifically for the conservation of the great Indian bustard, which is the heaviest flying bird belonging to the avian family of Otididae.
Node N2 output: The major geological event around 6,200 BCE that led to the submergence of land areas was the flooding of Doggerland by rising sea levels. This area, which connected Great Britain to continental Europe, was gradually reduced to low-lying islands before its final submergence, possibly following a tsunami caused by the Storegga Slide. This event resulted in the loss of a rich habitat and human habitation in the Mesolithic period.

1. Asia Poker: Players are dealt seven cards and must divide them into a four-card hand (High), a two-card hand (Medium), and a one-card hand (Low). The High hand must be equal or greater in poker ranking than the Medium hand, and the Medium hand must be equal or greater than the Low hand.

2. Community Card Poker (e.g. Texas Hold 'em): Players are dealt privately with incomplete hands ("hole cards") and combine them with the community cards dealt face up in the center of the table to make a complete hand. The best 5-card poker hand is formed from the player's two hole cards and the five community cards.

3. Pyramid Poker: Three cards are dealt face down, and players arrange them into a 2-card hand and a 1-card hand, with the 2-card hand being larger than the 1-card hand. There are no straights or flushes in the 2-card hand, and a higher-ranked hand wins in both the hands.

These are the specific rules for constructing hands in the identified poker games.
Node 3 output: 1. In Asia Poker, a player can choose to hold a total of seven cards in their hand, which they must divide into a four-card hand, a two-card hand, and a one-card hand.

Node 4 output: In the 19th century, tribal constitutions were signed in various locations, particularly in Oklahoma, as part of the process of Native American tribes negotiating with the U.S. government. Oklahoma was the site of several significant events related to Native American history during this time period.

One of the most notable events in Oklahoma's history is the Trail of Tears, which took place in the 1830s. This forced relocation of Native American tribes, including the Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek, Seminole, and Chickasaw, from their ancestral lands in the southeastern United States to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) resulted in the signing of treaties and agreements that impacted the governance and sovereignty of these tribes.

The signing of tribal constitutions in Oklahoma in the 19th century was a result of the U.S. government's efforts to establish formal relationships with Native American tribes and to define the rights and responsibilities of both parties. These constitutions were often signed as part of treaties and agreements between the tribes and the U.S. government, and they played a crucial role in shaping the political and legal status of the tribes within the framework of the United States.

The historical context of these events in Oklahoma is deeply intertwined with the broader history of Native American relations with the U.S. government, including issues of land rights, sovereignty, and self-governance. The signing of tribal constitutions in Oklahoma during the 19th century reflects the complex and often contentious process of negotiation and compromise between the U.S. government and Native American tribes.

Overall, the historical context of the signing of tribal constitutions in Oklahoma in the 19th century is a significant aspect of Native American history and the ongoing struggle for tribal sovereignty and self-determination. These events continue to have a lasting impact on the political, legal, and cultural landscape of Oklahoma and the United States as a whole.
Node 5 output: The tribal government that fits all the criteria of being legal, autonomous, North American, and signing its constitution in Oklahoma on September 6, 1839 is the Cherokee Nation. The Cherokee Nation signed its constitution on that date in 1839, and it was a significant event in the history of the tribe's governance and sovereignty. This event took place in Oklahoma, and it reflects the complex and often contentious process of negotiation and compromise between the U.S. government and Native American tribes during the 19th century. The Cherokee Nation's constitution signing in Oklahoma is a crucial aspect of Native American history and the ongoing struggle for tribal sovereignty and self-determination.

Node node_1 output: In the 1980s, Budweiser utilized mascots as part of their marketing strategy, specifically with the creation of Spuds MacKenzie. Spuds MacKenzie was a fictional dog character created for an extensive advertising campaign for Bud Light beer. The campaign was created by a 23-year-old art director, Jon Moore, and was overseen by Michael J. Roarty, an American marketing executive for Anheuser-Busch. Roarty is widely credited with turning Anheuser-Busch and its products, including Budweiser, into globally recognized brands through advertising. He also oversaw the creation of the Bud Light ad campaign featuring Spuds McKenzie during the late 1980s.

The use of mascots in advertising was a significant part of Budweiser's marketing strategy in the 1980s, as it helped to create a recognizable and memorable character associated with their brand. This approach was successful, as large amounts of Spuds merchandise, such as plush toys and t-shirts, were available during the height of his popularity. The use of mascots in advertising was a key element in creating a strong brand identity for Budweiser during this time period.

Additionally, he was involved in the creation of the 1993 film "George Balanchine's The Nutcracker," which was released by Warner Bros. Balanchine also worked with Heather Watts, a principal ballerina with the New York City Ballet, and created numerous principal roles for her in his masterpieces. Overall, Balanchine's influence and involvement in various production companies and ballet productions have left a lasting impact on the world of dance and entertainment.
Node 4 output: The production company involved in creating a live stage version of Casablanca and associated with George Balanchine is Warner Bros. This is based on the information that Warner Bros. was involved in the production of the 1993 film "George Balanchine's The Nutcracker," and also that a projected world tour of "Casablanca, The Dance" was cancelled when Warner Bros. ceased live theatre operations. Additionally, George Balanchine's involvement with Warner Bros. further supports the connection between the production company and the live stage version of Casablanca.

Balanchine also founded the School of American Ballet and later went on to create his own production companies. He was known for creating new works and instructing at his school, as well as choreographing for his later companies.
Node 2 output: The 1942 film "Casablanca" is a significant American romantic drama film directed by Michael Curtiz. Set during World War II, the film focuses on an American expatriate who must choose between his love for a woman and helping her husband, a Czech Resistance leader, escape the Vichy-controlled city of Casablanca to continue his fight against the Nazis. The film stars Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Henreid, and has become a classic in American cinema. Its enduring popularity and cultural impact have led to references in other films, such as the 2017 Moroccan drama "Razzia," and even inspired a live-stage dance version created by the Los Angeles Dance Theater. The film's influence is also evident in the use of its title for other works, such as the soundtrack to the 1980 film "Foxes" and the 1942 American musical film "Flying with Music."
Node 3 output: The live stage adaptation of the film "Casablanca" was produced by the Los Angeles Dance Theater in collaboration with Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures, Inc. The production was titled "Casablanca, The Dance" and premiered in Beijing, China in 2005. However, the world tour of the production was cancelled when Warner Bros. ceased live theatre operations. There have been rumors of a revival of the "Casablanca, The Dance" world tour following Warner Bros.'s restart of producing musicals.
Node 4 output: Based on the information from the upstream tasks, there is no evidence to suggest that George Balanchine was involved in creating a live stage version of Casablanca. Balanchine was primarily known for his work as a ballet choreographer and founder of ballet companies, and there is no indication that he was involved in the production of "Casablanca, The Dance" or any other live stage adaptation of the film. Therefore, it is unlikely that George Balanchine was involved in creating a live stage version of Casablanca.
Node 1 output: Key entities in the question are:
1. George Balanchine
2. 1942 film Casablanca
Node 2 output: George Balanchine, a renowned choreographer and dancer, is best known for his work in the world of ballet. He did not found any production companies himself, but he had a significant impact on the production of "The Nutcracker" ballet. The Nutcracker received its first complete production in the U.S. in 1944, performed by the San Francisco Ballet, and later George Balanchine's production opened in New York in 1954. Additionally, the 1993 film "The Nutcracker" is also known as George Balanchine's The Nutcracker, indicating his influence on the production.

While Balanchine did not found any production companies, his legacy and influence in the world of dance and ballet are undeniable. His work continues to be celebrated and performed by companies and artists around the world.

There have been rumors about the revival of the "Casablanca, The Dance," world tour, but no further information is available.
Node 4 output: Based on the information retrieved, it does not appear that George Balanchine founded a company specifically for a stage version of Casablanca. While he had a significant impact on the production of "The Nutcracker" ballet and his work continues to be celebrated and performed by companies and artists around the world, there is no evidence to suggest that he was involved in the creation of a stage version of Casablanca. The production of "Casablanca, The Dance" was commissioned by Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures, Inc. and premiered in 2005, but there is no indication that George Balanchine was directly involved in this project.
Node 5 output: It does not appear that George Balanchine founded a company to produce the stage version of Casablanca.
Node 1 output: Yes, there is a live stage version of the film Casablanca from 1942, called "Casablanca, The Dance," which premiered in Beijing, China in 2005. George Balanchine was not directly involved in the production of "Casablanca, The Dance," but the company responsible for creating the live-stage dance version, the Los Angeles Dance Theater, was founded by John Clifford, who was a principal dancer and choreographer with George Balanchine’s New York City Ballet. Clifford was widely considered to be Balanchine’s protégé and had a close association with him during his time with the New York City Ballet. Therefore, while Balanchine himself was not directly involved in the live stage version of Casablanca, his influence can be seen through his protégé's involvement in the production.
Node 2 output: George Balanchine founded several production companies throughout his career, including Les Ballets 1933, American Ballet, and the Los Angeles Dance Theater. Les Ballets 1933 was a short-lived ballet company that Balanchine co-founded with Boris Kochno, which allowed him to create new works set to music that had not yet been choreographed. American Ballet was the first professional ballet company Balanchine created in the United States, with the help of Lincoln Kirstein and Edward Warburg. The Los Angeles Dance Theater was founded by Balanchine protege John Clifford and was requested by Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures, Inc. to create a live-stage dance version of the film "Casablanca." These production companies played a significant role in Balanchine's career and legacy in the world of ballet.
Node 3 output: Based on the analysis of the companies founded by George Balanchine, it is evident that the Los Angeles Dance Theater, founded by Balanchine's protégé John Clifford, was involved in creating a live-stage dance version of the film "Casablanca." While Balanchine himself was not directly involved in the production, his influence can be seen through his protégé's involvement in the creation of "Casablanca, The Dance." Therefore, there is an indirect connection between George Balanchine and the stage production of the film "Casablanca."
Node 1 output: George Balanchine was a renowned choreographer and dancer, known for his influential work in the world of ballet. He co-founded Les Ballets 1933, a ballet company that showcased his original works set to new music. Balanchine also played a significant role in the careers of ballerinas such as Darci Kistler, Gelsey Kirkland, and Heather Watts, creating principal roles for them in his ballets. He was also involved in the founding of the American Ballet, the first professional ballet company he created in the United States. Additionally, he mentored choreographer John Clifford, who went on to have a successful career in the dance world. Balanchine's impact on the world of ballet is evident through the numerous dancers and choreographers he influenced and the legacy of his works that continue to be performed today.
Node 2 output: The production companies founded by George Balanchine are Les Ballets 1933 and American Ballet.
